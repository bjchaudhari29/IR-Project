289,47,"Baby Einstein Takealong Tunes...Is it TOXIC? I was wanting something to round out my order with Amazon last week, ya know, to get the free shipping deal.  I found what looked like a perfect item.  Baby Einstein's Takealong Tunes.  I was looking at the product info and found a statement that said something to the effect of they are required to notify the consumer of Proposition 65 (this was a link).  I clicked on the link and it took me another statement that said something like the product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer or repoductive harm.  I couldn't believe it!  I emailed Baby Einstein and they forwarded my email to the maker of the toy and I got back this response:I want to assure you that Kids II products are safe. Our products are latex free and paint materials are non-toxic. Our products meet and pass necessary requirements for phthalates, PVC's and BPA's. In addition to the tests that are performed by both U.S. and International standards, we also perform testing and go through extra safety procedures with parents and children within our local area. Not only do our products meet the requirements they are also certified by the accredited independent laboratories mentioned with Intertek and Bureau Veritas. In being a private company I hope that you will understand that we are unable to provide specific details on the materials within the products. However in being parents ourselves, we want to share the same confidence with you that we have in allowing our children to play with our products. In other words...they refused to tell me exactly what the warning was pertaining to!  I wrote back for further clarification and haven't received a response.  Today, about a week and a half later and they have now REMOVED the link to the warning!!!  What's going on?  Is this toxic or isn't it???http://www.oehha.org/prop65.htmlAny info would be appreciated!  Thanks.Nadine"

350,57,"Contours Tandem VS City Min? We are trying to figure out what stroller we should get for our newborn and 21 month old... I think we have it narrowed down to the countours tandem and the city mini. We are looking for something that is durable, easy to lift in & out of my SUV, something that can handle both dirt paths and sidewalks and something that can go in & out of stores easily.  Are we looking for the impossible?  I love that the children can face each other in the countours, but I worry about the bulk and it's ability to navigate snowy walkways.  My husband thinks we need something with bigger wheels, like a jogger stroller, but I find them to be too heavy.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

I still like to have the older child closer to me when I push because it makes it so much easier to controll the stroller. Are there other tandem stroller out there that let me do that as well? How about the \'Contours Options Tandem Stroller\' ? Can the infant car seat adopter be placed in the front seat position?"
356,57,How would I know its Kolcraft Options Plus the new model ? so there is new and a old model. New is known as Options Plus whereas the old is just Kolcraft Optionns Tandem.I bought the new one but the box does not have th Plus word on it. Did I get a old one?
357,57,"Doesn't anyone elses kid drink or snack on the ride? Why is everyone so positive and happy about the fact that this stroller has two cup holders for the driver (and an iPod deck in the Plus model), and no one, in their complaints, mentions the fact that THERE IS NO CUP HOLDER FOR THE KIDS!!  At least not in the pictures. If you own this and it DOES have that PLEASE post that information. Because that is the make it or break it deal for me.  I have two boys, and no they CAN\'T just hold their snack cup or sippy while riding, they like to do other things with their hands and when they tire of holding a cup they throw it down if they have nowhere to put it. I'm AMAZED that no one seems to miss this feature on this stroller.  I will not buy it if it doesn't have that, I hate to be constantly leaning around to hand them stuff. My overall comfort is based on knowing they can help themselves."
