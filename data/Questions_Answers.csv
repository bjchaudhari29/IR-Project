1,0,Will this keep a strong 6 year old out of my cabinets? He has special needs and feels that he can open my cabinets and dump whatever on the floor. I am looking for something that would prevent him to get in my cabinets.,"It probably will...  it's pretty good and much better than those locks for drawers you can buy at baby stores.  But it's still plastic so depending on how strong he is, he might break it.  You'll also need to keep the magnetic key away from him as he'll see you using it and likely learn.  My 3 year old tries but he doesn't know the exact spot to put the key to unlock the door.  Overall after trying several locks for cabinet doors this was the best in my opinion.  But also the hardest to install so as long as you plan and execute well according to instructions it will be fine."
1,1,What's the difference between this and the regular locking set (not the \'tot lok\' set)?,The size of the locking mechanism. I bought these so they could be used with the drawers in my kitchen--the other one I looked at wouldn't fit my drawers.
1,2,I have these locks on my cabinets and love them! Do they work on kitchen drawers?,"Yes, I have them in cabinets and drawers. They work exactly the same as the doors"
1,3,Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Deluxe Starter Set: Do these locks work on glass doors of the kitchen?,You must have some type of wood or some other way to affix the locks to your cabinetry. You might be able to with some very strong adhesive but screwing into wood is perhaps the best
1,4,I seem to have misplaced my magnet.  Is there a way to buy just it.,Yes you can buy just the tot lok magnet key Safety 1st Tot-Lok Magnetic Key (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
2,5,does this have a high enough splash guard for,"No, My grandson constantly goes over the top or when he is dead on target it goes around the splash guard and over the sides.  Needs to be higher and wider."
2,6,Are the two pieces made by hard plastic? No soft cushiony at all?,"Yes, both pieces are made of hard plastic. There are no soft, cushiony parts."
2,7,"My daughter is 17 months old (24lbs, 30\' tall) & am wondering if the splash guard is problematic for little girls?",Could be? Not sure... It's a bit odd but I'm thinking it's to splash back instead of it peeling out for boys? My daughter hasn't used it
2,8,Is there a replacement white potty available to fit in this chair?,"I haven't had to replace the potty insert, but here is Baby Bjorn's Customer Service contact #. (866) 424-0200"
2,9,Is it good for girls?,"I am currently using it to potty train my boy (10-month-old). He likes to sit on it and gestures when he is done and wants to be picked up. As for girls, I would assume it should also be OK to use. The chair is deep enough and the front end does not touch the baby (unless he really pushes himself to the front of the chair). That said, you shouldn't have to worry about any germs from the babies touching the plastic. Additionally, it is really easy to clean, the plastic part comes out easily and we \'decontaminate\' it with 10% beach every couple of days just in case."
2,10,does the removable insert of this potty chair stain easily?  Ie does it turn yellow because of the pee?,It doesn't stain if you wipe it out with something soft. DON'T use bleach (it reacts with the pee and creates a hard crust that doesn't come off) and DON'T use anything scrubby or abrasive (it will create a scratched surface that will stain and be hard to clean). As long as you use soft wipes it will clean easily for a long time.
2,11,Is this potty chair big enough/sturdy enough for 3-5 year olds (who are already potty-trained) for using on road trips?,"Its definitely sturdy. My 2 yr old is pretty comfortable and he is average size. It may work, you can always return it once you get it if your 5 yr old is too big. I agree its better than other options on the road. My 2 year hold sits on it sometimes 30 minutes reading books."
2,12,How is this compared to summer infant or fischer price?,"We used this and the fisher price. The fisher price potty was uncomfortable for my child (18 months at the time) to sit on. The splash guard is wider, forcing her legs apart more than was comfy for her. My child likes leaning back on the babybjorn, which she could not do with the fisher price one. The babybjorn potty is very versatile, my baby used it from 6 months and still likes it at 5 years even though she has long been potty trained."
2,13,Does the seat remove & fit onto a regular toilet also?,No
3,14,Would this work on the railings (?) going down the stairs on the angle or is this just for a straight across railing?,I used it on a staircase.  It was just fine.
3,15,Would it work on a spiral stairway?,I think it would. The material is very pliable and easily manuevered. Hope this helps!
3,16,Would a cat be able to damage the netting with his claws (poke holes in it)?,A cat would get their nails caught in it and rip it to shreds!
3,17,I know it is 10ft long but can you tell me how tall it is? I have a German Shepherd and don't want her to jump over it.,It's the height of a standard banister. Not sure that it would work for a German Shepherd. It's just netting.
3,18,"Would this product work for (townhome) railing going up the stairs to a second level, a gap in the bannister, and then stairs to a third level?","As the photo shows, it must attach to the top rail.  Since it is netting, it is flexible.  Don't know if this answers your question or not."
3,19,"Would purchasing one be enough to go around a small third floor apartment balcony, or would I need two or more? I have a 6 month old chihuhua, that I don't want to fit in between the balcony rails.","You'd really need to check measurements. I think it would be plenty tall for a chihuhua, but if the perimeter of your balcony is around 10 ft or more, it might not be enough to wrap."
3,20,How high is it?  will it fit a 3 foot high banister?,"Thank you for asking about one of our products. The Rail Net is 3 foot tall. It should work fine for your banister. If I can answer any other questions, please let me know."
3,21,How do you secure the bottom of the net?,"There are strings to attach the top, bottom,  and sides"
3,22,Does the 2 pk. as 10' mean two packs of 10' = 20' or just simply the 2pk. = 10'?,2 pk @ 10 each equaling 20 feet.  We had an over lap but were able to work it in with no problem.
4,23,does it work with the symphony,"I just called the customer service line, and the 12 Volt is compatible with the Symphony. It's Medela item # 67173 for reference."
4,24,is this usable in my car?,Yes this product is very useful and can be used in car
4,25,What is the output current of this adapter?,12 volt D.C
4,26,"This says it works with a Pump instyle manufactured before 2008 - does it work with the Advanced model? purchased in 2009, so not sure when manufactured","it worked with mine, not sure when it was manufactured, but I know it was before 2008"
4,27,will this work on the pump in style adv,"Yes, that is what I use it for."
4,28,does it com in medela retail packaging? Not sure whether it is geniune part from medela or other brand that can be used with medela?,Mine says Medela directly on it.  Not sure if that helps.  I can't remember what the packaging says.
4,29,"ASIN B000058DPL, is it geniune part from Medela in Medela retail pac",It is a Medela brand item.
5,30,Does this come with medium flow nipples?,No it comes with the slowest flow
5,31,Do they fit in Dr. Brown bottle warmer?,"They fit in the warmer I have, I am not certain I have the Dr. brown warmer though."
5,32,Can we heat Playtex ventaire bottle in bottle warmer? Can we heat Playtex ventaire bottle in bottle warmer with milk in it?,"Yes, I warm mine on the Avent bottle warmer and it works fine as long as i fill the warmer with water up to the top (so it doesnt warm just the thick bottom of the bottle."
5,33,Can I sanitise these bottles regularly in boiling hot water?,Nipples and vents can be boiled once a week for 5 minutes.  It says do not place bottle in boiling water for heating milk.  Upper rack of dishwasher in dry cycle recommended or hand wash in soapy water 1 minute.  This is per the written instructions included in the box.
5,34,Are these new wide opening bottles or the standard bottles that r discontinued by playtex?,The standard discontinued ones. They are my favorite and harder to find now.
5,35,if I want pink bottles how do I place it on the order?,"They won't sent you your requested color. I tried contacting Amazon after placing my order to request the bottles in pink. I just got run-around, then received bottles that were not the color I requested. You're better off buying them from BRU or Target if you want a specific color."
5,36,is it,"No its narrow, a baby can hold it"
5,37,CAn I get Boy Color?,No
5,38,Are these Playtex VentAire ADVANCED bottles or just Playtex Ventaire bottles?  Is there a difference?,I don't know. But they are the best bottles I've ever used.
5,39,how is this different than Dr. Brown bottles,"I've never used Dr Brown, but from what I know about them these are easier to disassemble and clean because there aren't as many parts."
6,40,Can this be also used for Playtex VentAire bottles?,"This is what the playtex website said:Can the Playtex\u00ae Nurser NaturaLatch\u00ae nipples be used with these bottles?Yes, Playtex\u00ae Nurser NaturaLatch\u00ae latex and silicone nipples can be used with the VentAire\u00ae wide bottles. For standard VentAire\u00ae bottles, you must use the VentAire\u00ae Standard nipples.Hope that helps.  I don't use ventaire so I can't really answer."
6,41,Can you use these with the Playtex Nurser bottles and/or the Playtex Premium nurser bottles? Thx,These are compatible with all playtex bottles
7,42,How wide is the opening?  Does it work with Comotomo Bottles?  I think they are wider and shorter than traditional bottles.,To be honest in not sure about the comoto bottles but the Tommy Tippee ones are very wide and this bottle warmer fits it.
7,43,Can you use this with breast milk?,"I don't think it would make a difference if it was breast milk or formula. But honestly I think this is a waste of money, it takes way too long to heat up, it would be quicker to hold bottle under hot running water! I regretted this purchase."
7,44,Can I use baby bottle warmers for Playtex drop in liners system? I was wondering if anyone uses bottle armers for the pllaytex drop in systems?thanks,"My 18 month old son isn't using them for milk anymore, just water at bedtime, but when he was, we would warm them.  We have an earlier version of this: The First Years Night Cravings Bottle Warmer & Cooler, Blue/WhiteI don't know how others work, but with ours, you add a specific amount of water based on the amount of liquid to heat.  This in effect, decreased the warming time substantially with the drop in liners, and we also used them with pumping bags that held milk that we then poured into the liners.  We used approximately 1/4 the amount of water it said to use for the size for frozen breastmilk to warm it, and about 1/8 for milk from the fridge.  You might try testing it out a bit with some milk to see how it works.  Eventually, we went to running the bottle of whole milk under hot water from the tap while swirling it around or putting it in a bowl of hot water (but the warmer was easier at first), and finally our son accepted it at the fridge temp.  When we wanted to transition off the bottle of milk at bedtime, we started adding water to it, and then eventually went to just water.  Now the only time he gets a bottle is at bedtime, and only with water.  The rest of the time, he drinks water from the sippy cup, and juice or milk from a little plastic cup at the table."
7,45,Is the timer silent when it is done? I need to have it at work.,There is a very faint click when it is done warming. The light on the switch also goes out when it is done.
7,46,Can a Tommee Tippee bottle fit into it?,"I've never used one but from the pictures i see on the website, it looks like it would fit. The bottle warmer is pretty wide u could drop a baseball in there if that gives u an idea of how big around it is haha."
7,47,Does anyone use this with the Playtex Dropin Nurser bottles and have good luck? we normal heat it by running under the facet but takes forever lol :p,"Well, we don't use those BUT we use glass bottles and we were also using running water or we would heat up our kettle.  This warmer has saved us SO much time.  It's fast!  Only thing is, if left in for too long, it will get really hot, so just follow the directions and it will work like a charm for you."
7,48,what size batteries does it require?,None. 1 button and a plug.
7,49,Can it heat glass bottle?,"Yes, glass baby food jars also"
8,50,Is this the older version that is circular and not oval?,I ordered it a while back and mine is oval-ish. Not the circular ones.
8,51,Where is this product made?,China
8,52,Is the food grinder BPA free?,"It is stated on the box, \'BPA and Phthalate FREE\'."
8,53,Is the strainer part stainless steel in addition to the cutter?,"I gave this to my sister....  FINALLY remembered to ask... she says, Yes, the part with the holes (\'strainer\') is metal too."
9,54,Is this treated with flame retardant chemicals?,The smaller sizes are not treated w/flame retardants.  Polyester is a natural flame retardant w/o using chemicals.  Hope this helps.
9,55,anyone have a tummy sleeper? does the zipper dig into their bodies if they sleep on their tummy?,"I don't have a tummy sleeper, but if the zipper is zipped up, the pull is at the very bottom of the sack, probably lower than the feet unless the bag is really small for your baby. At that location, I don't think your baby will have a lot of weight to put on the zipper pull (and causing the dig). As for the zipper itself, it is pretty flat so I don't think it will be a problem.Just a reminder that if your baby is less than 6 month old, he or she should be sleeping on the back all the time to reduce the chance of SIDS."
9,56,Hi!  Would this be considered the \'summer weight\' sleep sac option?  Or would this be too thick for the summer?,"I plan to use ours in the summer, with onesies underneath. :) I wouldn't consider it too thick."
9,57,My granddaughter sleeps better with her arms and body swaddled but she is outgrowing her swaddles.  Could I zip up this sack with her arms inside?,Technically yes but this sleep sack is loose so her arms would be free to move and likely tangled in the arm holes.  I wouldn't recommend it.
9,58,Does this allow babies to roll over?  My little one is 7 months and rolls himself over before sleeping.,Yes it does. It moves as the baby moves and it's comfortable for them and makes them feel secure. My 20 month old still uses it every now and then when all his pajamas are in the dirty laundry.  And he sleeps 10.5-11hrs. Hope that helps!
9,59,Is there much of a difference between the L and XL besides length? If I put my M size baby in a L or XL would there be a problem?,"The XL size would be too roomy, allowing the sleep sack to twist around babies legs thus making it uncomfortable for a sleeping child.  It's best to stay within one size of your child's size.  I believe that the shoulder width is about the same and it is the length that changes with the larger sizes."
10,60,Does the seat have a crotch strap or is it just the waste strap?,"Yes, it has a crotch strap & works great."
10,61,toddler,My grandson is one and has no problem.
10,62,Would you need a separate high chair for a baby or can you just use this chair?,"This booster chair is great for occasional or temporary use while traveling or days at grandma's house (that's me). I have been considering trading up to a full high chair since baby is now with me often. I have this booster in a regular size wooden chair, which places baby too low to be comfortably fed while adult is standing, for instance, and lower than others when seated around the table. I hoped to avoid the extra piece of furniture (high chair), but I'm thinking it might be better for everyone. If I were the mom, I'd go for a full size high chair."
10,63,"Is the red & white one, truly red or more burgundy like the picture online looks?",I think it looks a little more red in person than than the picture but it's definitely not bright red.
10,64,is this ok for a small 2 yea,Yes
10,65,"Can you set it on the floor, place the baby (who can sit upright) in it and use it for playtime? We would be sitting right next to baby.",Yes  you can do that My kid is two years old so he can't sit like that but baby can sit in it
10,66,where is it made from?,Mine is made in Mexico.
10,67,at what size does your child \'out grow\' being able to use the plastic tray?,Each child is different but generally I think seat + tray works until 2 - 2 1/2 years.
10,68,"Would it be OK to use it outside? On a deck table / chair? Will it be OK to get wet, etc?",They can get wet. I have put mine in a kiddie pool and the bath tub. The straps are adjustable so depending on the width of the seat of your deck chair and the back of your deck chair it should fit. I have used them with a folding chair also. And they can sit on the ground too. Kids always supervised of course:)
11,69,Has anyone had problems with the motor failing? We have only been using this swing for a few months sporatically and now the motor is junk.  It does not swing.  Has anyone else experienced this same problem?,"Yes I bought one and my son used it for a couple months until the motor quite working. So I just stopped using the swing at first, then i started using it again and just manually pushing it (not fun) and now he's 4 1/2 months old and loves the swing other than the fact that it don't swing. So I decided to finally call Fisher price. The lady was very nice and helpful. She asked me a couple questions then she said we can ship you a new motor but the motors are on back order, if you don't want to wait you can mail the legs in and we will ship you a brand new swing. Of course I said yes.  :-) very happy with there products as well as their customer service . The Snugabunny bouncy seat is just as amazing as the swing.   ;-)"
11,70,"Which models have AC power adapter? The way seemingly different swings are all presented under the same heading is confusing.  According to the descriptions of the different \'styles\' the blue one with the stars is the only one with the AC option.  When I visit other websites, sometimes the butterfly one has this option, too.  Is that true here?Update:After confirming that the model number matched the manufacturer listing for a swing with the option to plug it in, I took a chance and ordered the butterfly swing.  It does indeed come with an ac adapter, so the Amazon description claiming that it required batteries is in error.","If it helps anybody, I just received the Nature's Touch (N1973) version of the Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing and it does NOT have an AC adapter. It takes batteries only. I think Amazon should not group all of these swings together. I read the reviews on Amazon and was excited to think that my model would come with an AC adapter."
11,71,"25 pound weight limit accurate? Hi,I am looking for a baby swing form my 7 month old since he has been in one before and loved it. My problem is, he is a larger baby, weighing 21 pounds right now so I don't want to buy a swing if it will only last a couple of months. Do you think the weight limit of 25 pounds is accurate? Has anybody tried this swing with a larger baby?Thanks!","I'm having a similar concern. My little girl is 5 months old, 18 pounds, and her feet stick out over the cradle as she is 26 1/2\' inches in length. Last week she managed to pull at the canopy and got it tangled in the mobile, so I've had to remove it. I'd say this swing is most useful for babies under 16 lbs and under 25\' in length. I'm now shopping for something else."
11,72,"Battery Life? I was looking at getting the fisher price cradle swing, and I was wondering how long the batteries last?  An estimate will help me decide between different models.","I've used adapters to use AA rechargeables. I don't like this method as I constantly have to change the batteries.My wife asked me to modify it (I'm an engineer but the mod is actually quite simple) to plug in. Parts:6V adapter ($5-10, free if you have one lying around. You can use a 5V adapter just fine).barrel connector socket ($1-2)barrel connector of corresponding size ($1-2)Drill a hole through battery cover and secure barrel connector socket. Run wires from barrel connector (solder wires) to battery terminals. Takes about 10-15 minutes. For another $10-20 you can probably set it up with 4 AA NiMh in the compartment. That's what I did but I put cheap batteries in it and my wife says it only runs about 45 minutes before it dies."
11,73,Short waist belt straps Does anyone have a problem with the waist belt straps being too short? I loosened the belt all the way and I still can't buckle up my kid ... he is only 12 lbs. It seems a bit tight already when we got it a few weeks ago when he was only 10lbs.,We bought this swing for our infant son who weighs approx. 10 lbs and the straps on our swing will soon be too tight since there is no room to loosen them any further.  I suppose it's possible that we both bought swings with straps that are too short.  I plan on contacting the manufacturer to see if they can send new straps.
11,74,Papasan Cradle Swing Are there replacement cushions available to buy seperately?,Look on ebay- lots of parts/ covers etc there.
12,75,How Tall is this gate and can it extend to 108 inches?,It is approx 15 Inches tall. And it extends fully to 108 inches.
12,76,Does this gate bend? I need a gate that bends around curved stairs,No this gate does not bend. It is on a wood frame with steel runners and it would not be conducive to a curved stair case.
12,77,How small can this gate get? The descption says 28\' wide in one paragraph and 60\' wide in the next.,The gate consists of four 28\' sections. When assembled it telescopes to 60\' wide.
12,78,Can this be used outdoors on a deck?,It might be okay depending on how exposed it is to the weather. It is wood with some metal peices and needs two walls with eyehooks to install. If left in the rain overtime the wood would warp and the metal would rust.
12,79,From all I can see this gate does not swing open....why then do they call it an \'Extra Wide Swing Gate\'?,"It does swing open. It attaches to the wall on both sides and there is metal hardware on the sides that latches to the wall hardware. But it isn't particularly sturdy or easy (for an adult) to latch and unlatch. Overall, it's an okay swing gate for a low traffic area but maybe not for an area where it would need to open and close frequently or where it may be left open."
12,80,Will this hate hold up to an 11 month old who is trying to walk?,If installed properly. It has to be anchored in the wall and if they don't shake it constantly . We didn't install it right ( we are not handy) and my 15 month old pulled the screws out of the wall by shaking and rocking the gate
12,81,"Can it be installed between two cement walls? Cement block construction, corner pillars solid cement, stucco over it. Would I need bigger screws?",You can but you will need cement eyehole anchors and predrill.
12,82,Can it fit unparallel walls?,It is a latch type of gate where you will need to screw eye hooks into your walls.  This is not a tension based gate.
12,83,Will this gate hold a medium-sized dog (~40 lbs.) and an active toddler?,It holds my 55 lb dog and 1 year old just fine. The dog doesn't jump on it though. I don't know if it would hold up to that.
13,84,Are lansinoh storage bags compatible with this bottle?,"It is possible, but I think there is more of a chance of leaks.  I still pour the milk from the Lasinoh bags (or another freezer equivalent) into the Playtex dropins after the milk defrosts.  Yes, this makes you use two bags, but I'd rather not loose any breastmilk!!"
13,85,Do the 4oz liners expand if you fill them with more than 4oz of milk?,"No, they're pretty much 4oz liners, although you can fill a little more than that especially if you get the pre-shaped drop-in liners rather than the bags. On the drop-ins, the 4oz. line doesn't go all the way to the rim of the bottle, so you could get a bit more in if you'd like but not much. If you want to put in 5oz or more, go for the 8oz liners. To me, that's the beauty of this system of Playtex bottles... I had the 8oz bottle but, for the vast majority of his time on the bottle my son only drank about 4oz at a time so I just used the 4oz liners in the 8oz bottle--no problem--and never had to buy sets of 4oz bottles PLUS sets of 8oz bottles."
13,86,Slow nipples are included?,"Yes, slow nipples included"
13,87,Can you use the 4oz drop-ins with the 8oz bottles?,"yes you can, I do it sometimes but only if I am in a rush because it is hard to squeeze out the air. 4 oz and 8 oz drop-ins are the same ring size, the 4 oz ones are just \'shorter\'."
13,88,Can you heat these in a bottle warmer or will it melt the liner?,No not in a bottle warmer you put hot water in a cup or heated water and place the bottle inside that for 2 minutes or depending how warm the water is because if it's in hot water it'll get hot fast.
13,89,Do all the colors come in the new angled version? Thank you!,"I dont know, I ordered these and recieved the white older version that dont bend. Which I prefer."
13,90,hi! can you use 8 oz drop ins  with the 4 oz bottles? what would be the drawback?,"You can, however the liner would be below the bottle and difficult to use. Best bet would be to use 4oz drop in with the 4oz bottle. It's easier to use 8 oz or 10 oz drop in in a 8 oz bottle."
13,91,I am unclear how exactly I can heat up the content in the drop-in liner whether it is formula or cold breastmilk? Can you use bottle warmer?,"I'm not sure about a bottle warmer, since the bag inserted to the bottle means that the milk/formula wouldn't get much contact with the outside surface of the bottle being warmed. When I pumped, I just warmed my stored containers of breastmilk in a hot water bath before putting them in the bottle. When my son was on formula, he liked it room temperature so as long as I kept a supply of water in a bottle on the counter, I had no need to warm it. A few times I did need to warm the breastmilk while it was in the bottle (had stored the milk in the bottle in the fridge) and I just submerged the whole thing in a hot water bath and dried it off before giving it to my son."
13,92,I currently use the Ventaire system. After a few months of use they now leak out of the bottom no matter how carefully I assemble them. Do these leak?,"No, only if the bottle is upside down it leaks out. But have not had any other problems with leaking. Even considering the force i put on them to get the air out. Biggest mess i have had with these was a 3am feeding when i was half asleep..i poured the formula into it before i put the liner!! And if you do use these its cheapest on Amazons subscribe and save."
14,93,can you make this into a,No.
14,94,What exactly are they?,"Sharp pieces of broken glass, at least that's what I found when I opened the package."
14,95,I want to know what they are for I thought something different,"You grab the bottom bulb and the liquid is supposed to seem like its boiling instantly at the top (with the good ones at least). However, these barely accomplish that sought after boiling action. The liquid merely peters out at the top rather than boil."
14,96,Is there a way to get all styles and colors pictured?,Yes when you place your order just let us know and we will ship out color and style of choice.
14,97,"are they made of glass of plastic?  If plastic , is it impact resistant ?",They are made of glass. I don't think they'd take any significant impact without breaking.
14,98,how many boilers do i get with my order it shows four on the picture but the details do not say if i get all four or just one it only says \'colors may vary\'and again this question is regarding the Westminster Hand Boilers  Thanks,"You receive one boiler, the pictures just show the 4 types they have available."
14,99,"My kids got a red and a blue boiler for Christmas, was wondering if there was a way to request a green and a p","Yes, you can call or email and request colors.  Sometimes we are out of certain colors but currently we have them all.  Email or call as quickly as possible because we will ship quickly and then we cannot change what we have shipped.  We are happy to accommodate requests."
14,100,does this one come as a set of all four or do I have to get them seperate,You only get one per order.
14,101,"This  is listed in the baby section, are you sure that's a good","We were not aware of this, we did not do the original listing and we will confirm that it is moved to a different category.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention."
15,102,Do you have to use the screw in wall cups?  I have to use it between two cupboards at the start of my kitchen. I don't want to screw into/damage wood,"No, I did not use the screw in wall cups. They're an optional component to the gate and it says that you should use the screw in wall cups at the top of the stairs but other places in home are fine to not use the screws"
15,103,"Can a 4-yr old open this gate easily?  I want to keep the baby from falling down the stairs, but allow toddlers through easily.",Yes as long as the lock is not engaged.  This gate closes securely and has an additional push button lock.  If the lock is not engaged a baby will be safe behind it but a toddler can still lift the handle to go through.
15,104,I would like to mount this gate to the top of our stairs. One side is wall and the other side is bannister. The Kidco spindles don't fit it. Help?,"That's where we use it, and as it has a threshold, it's a bit difficult to step through and balance. My son in law bought hardware which attaches to the bannister, and added a wooden support to the bottom of the gate. Sorry, not sure where he got the pieces that straddle the bannister and close with Velcro. We only use it when they visit, at their house they use a gate that is meant for the top of the stairs and has no bottom pice to walk over, much safer."
15,105,What is the distance between bars?,The upright bars aren't equally spaced. The widest distance is 3\' with some closer to 2 1/2\'.
15,106,Can this be installed at the top of the stairs?,Yes
15,107,Does it close automatically?,No it does not but it closes easily with one hand. :)
15,108,I have wide gap in the gate ... not sure how to fix the gate ...,If the gap is between the gate and the panel that touches the wall then the pegs that fasten it against the wall need to be tightened.  Top and bottom pegs must be tightened the same.  If the top is not tightened as much as the bottom it will leave a gap at the top that keep the latch from closing.
15,109,can this gate be solid mounted at an ,It can be mounted with the screws that come with it. Directly into the wall. Straight. No Angles.
16,110,I am looking for the one that has a 3-1/4\' arm that will work with my flush mounted cabinets.  The standard ones aren't long enough for me,We don't carry anything that long but I would call the vendor directly to see if they carry it and what the item# is - (800) 553-5529
16,111,Is this lock visible from the outside of the cabinet?,This lock is not visible from the outside. It works really well.
17,112,What year was this product made in? I just want to check it is a newer version since the 2010 recall of this product.,We received it as a gift and it was 2012 version. But I am not sure whether it was from Amazon.
17,113,can baby be placed forward or only toward the person carrying her/him?,When the child can support the weight of their head on their own then you can fold down the head/neck support and have them face forward.
18,114,Has anyone travelled internationlly with this stroller?did it fit in the overhead compartment? Would this work for a 12 month old?weight capacity?,"I have flown with a stroller a good handful of times and every time we have flown the airline checks your stroller at the gate (don't panic) and then it is at your next stop on the tarmac right as you exit the plane! Even if you have a big stroller they do this. You will NOT have to put your stroller in an overhead is what I am getting at, the airline will take care of it. BUT if you did have to yes this would probably fit because it folds up pretty small. Yes, it will hold your one year old. I use it for my beastly two year old and she fits just fine! There is not a lot of storage space underneath, but that is with any umbrella stroller, this one is actually pretty generous considering. I really like this stroller and have been happy with it for about a year now. It has held up well, it is great for travel and it reclines so she can sleep in too."
18,115,does stroller come with rain cover? ,"It does come with a sun/shade cover, but if you're referring to something plastic, or something that keeps the child's body dry, this stroller does not come with that."
18,116,Will my tall toddlers feet drag on the ground?,"The stroller has a footrest above the two front wheels.   Our four year old is very comfortable inside, I'd say your tall toddler will be okay!"
18,117,"I have a 43 inch, 38 pound toddler. Is this too small? We love our city mini, but it's heavy for travel. If not the chicco, any travel stroller ideas?","My Toddler weights 25lbs and she just fits in this stroller. This stroller is not made as well as it once was made. I find it to be cheaply made does not recline all the way down but it does serve a purpose of being light and easy to handle. I keep mine in my truck for quick trips to bank, grocery shop etc."
18,118,newborn,It does not have the support for a newborn.
18,119,what is the weight capacity of this stroller?,40lb
18,120,Is this stroller comfortable to use for tall people? Like 6ft tall?,Good Travel Stroller and yes comfortable for people 6ft tall.
18,121,does it have a cup ,"No, it does not."
18,122,that car is fully baby lying in one of its positions????,"No, there is not a fully reclined position, if that's what you're asking.  There is very upright and not-so-upright.  \'Recline\' is really a very loosely-used term when used in relation to this stroller. :)  Having said that, I love this stroller.  I used it for my 6-month-old with no problems.  The reclined position is just reclined enough that she could nap without slumping.  The straps are not a harness though, so you'll have to be careful with that."
19,123,Does this cover work with babybjorn miracle?,Yes I have the Miracle as well! This cover would work for most any type! It is like a big sack with elastic around the edges that you just slip over the top!
19,124,We have the Babybjorn one.  Is the hood detachable to be used on it's own without the cover?,"Hi,I'm not sure what do you mean by this question...This cover is hooked on the BabyBjorn carrier but you don't have to  use the cover when using the carrier.Please let me know if you have more questions...- Inbal."
19,125,can you put the cover on when wearing the baby facin,"I don't see why not. Our son usually faces out but the hood snaps on so could go either way and the rest of it is from neck down so it shouldn't matter. I haven't tried it but yes, seems like it would work facing you."
19,126,will this fit a standard baby carrier that isn't baby bjorn ,Yes it is basically a big pouch that just fits around your child! It has elastic around the edge so you can tuck it around baby! Very easy and handy!
19,127,Is the material of this product  waterproof?,it is not waterproof. it is a kind of fleece material so I think it is ok for light rain.
19,128,I live in Florida and am looking for a cover for the rain? Does it do well in the rain? Would it keep the baby too hot? Thanks!,"I think it might be fine in the rain, but I definitely think it would be too warm for Florida weather."
20,129,"similar product for single baby is under 70$, would you have purchase 2 of those instead of 1 for twin","I would have done two separate: reason being that once they are maybe 3 months old and stirring a bit, they kind of almost roll towards the middle/separator and also are more aware of the other one (not very much, but still).  They also just outgrow this so fast.  I would just have two mini cribs from the get-go, because that is what we ended up using for the next year.  Good luck, have fun!"
20,130,Have any of you used this as crib for twins?,We only used the bassinet part for the first couple of months while they were in our room. Now they sleep in their own cribs.
20,131,is it po,Yes it is. It is actually quite easy to pack up.
20,132,I would like to buy an additional thicker mattress for the twin pack n play. Where would I find that?,"We have twin grand babies, have not researched that particular item and cannot provide information.  However, Shanna has provided a very good idea.  It is very important that it fit snugly."
20,133,"Can each of the bassinet be removed separately from the entire unit, in case if you want bring babies to different location? Thx'","No, the bassinet attachment is a single \'hanging platform\' that has dividers with the bassinet canopy.  We really would NOT recommend this as a twin bassinet.  We are actually using this as a portable changing station when we are on the go, but we have to do the changing on our knees so we don't kill our backs..."
20,134,"Does the bassinet fit in the carrying bag? If so, how? Outside the 4 walls that the pad folds up to make?","Exactly, the pad folds in four with everything else inside of it. The good thing is that it has two straps, so you can tighten it and can fit into the carrying bag."
21,135,"Britax seats in Prius? Hi,I am trying to pick a convertible car seat that fits securely into a Prius.  Any recommendations, Brtiax or otherwise?Thanks!",We're having the *exact* same problem as scientific illustrator.  The Britax Roundabout will not sit securely in the middle of our Prius.  The car seat base is more narrow than the middle cushion so the car seat tilts and wobbles.  We are trying to return the Roundabout and are looking for suggestions on which convertible car seat will work.  Please advise!!  Thank you
21,136,"roundabout for Newborns? Hi there,i have been researching various options for our baby who is on his way in April. I am wondering about buying a convertible for our newborn. what are other experiences of folks who might have done that? Any other reccomendations?Thanks","Thanks for your reply stephanie. The reason I was asking this Q was also because I was hoping to find a compatible Stroller for my baby with the Roundabout. But it appears that they dont make a stroller where you can just detach the car seat and fit it into a stroller, like they have for the Graco Snugride. What did you do in terms of having a convertible stroller...any Recommendations? Thanks"
21,137,"Does this seat work on an airplane? We're considering the Britax, but first we need to know from parents with experience if it can be used on airplanes.Thanks in advance for anyone who can help.",I posted pics on my profile and under the product page of the install rearfacing in an airplane.
21,138,"Britax Convertible seats and cup holders? I'm interested in the Britax seats, but can't determine if any of them have cup holders built in.  If not, does anyone know if there is a compatible accessory for Britax?",I have Britax seats for my twins and they do not have cup/snack holders.  It is the only thing I would change about the seats.  (I have the marathons).
21,139,"Expired 2002 Britax Roundabout I know that car seats have a 6 year expiration date, but we have a perfectly good britax roundabout that was made in 02. I feel like if anything was to ever happen to our child in a crash, I couldnt live with myself for using the old seat, but is it really as dangerous as my first time mother's imagination is making it seem?","The other answer is 100% correct!  The plastic becomes brittle over time, meaning it will break much easier in an accident.  This is especially true because carseats are in extremly hot and cold conditions in the car.  A carseat specialist told us that carseats in drier climates should expire after only 4 years.  Hope this helps!"
22,140,Will this cover work on dream on me 3 inch portable crib.matress ?,I don't have that particular mattress but I have a 3 inch mini crib mattress and the sheet fits perfectly. The nice thing about this sheet is it is jersey knit so it stretches and conforms nicely to the mattress. Hope that helps.
22,141,Would it be suggested to use this to cover the \'mattress\' that comes with the pack n play to make the surface not as hard?,Yes it fits that mattress. However I think there is enough room for a larger mattress if you choose to purchase one
22,142,Is this made to fit the pad that comes with a pack n play or for an extra mattress that is bought to fit in the pack n play?,It fits our mattress that came with the pack n play. We didn't buy an extra mattress but I think this pad would fit an extra mattress too.
22,143,Will this fit the Chicco Lullaby LX Playard? Planning for newborn...,I am not sure on the Playard.  It fits my mini crib perfectly.
22,144,It is actually made of cotton?,It is a cotton blend. cotton with some kind of  fiber filling in the quilting.
22,145,"Is this made for a pack 'n play 'on the go' model, which is a little smaller than the regular pack 'n play?  Amazon recommends it w/the on the go mode",hey Kelly its a snug fit on the regular pack n play so if the go is smaller it will be loose. I wouldn't get it for a nb but if your baby is older once a snug sheet is over it you should be fine
22,146,Will this fit over the dream on me foam pack n play mattress? It is a little smaller but I was wondering if it will stretch enough to fit. If not what,No
22,147,Will it fit the Arm's Reach MINI Co-Sleeper?,yes this fits the arm's reach mini co-sleeper.
23,148,"I see some negative reviews about it being to firm, I want a firm but comfy matress for my 11 lb 2 month old..is th","I saw the negative reviews as well before we purchased, but our Pediatrician (w/o making a brand recommendation) highly suggested we go with a mattress on the firmer side.  Our four month old at the time took to it immediately and is still sleeping soundly on it today.  We have rotated the mattress, because it has given in slightly over the time.  I hope this helps!"
23,149,"Since this is waterproof, is it necessary to have a mattress pad with this mat","Considering the firmness of the mattress, we found the mattress pad to be a big plus in added comfort.  I'm not sure if it's necessary for wetness protection though."
23,150,Can you provide some more detail about what the foam in the mattress is made of? What materials are used?,"Of course not, but I also believe she deserves a good nights sleep, and this did not provide that for her! Way too FIRM! As I said before, she might as well have been sleeping on a slab of concrete. My child deserves both the most comfortable, as well as a safe design. This product may be safe, but does not meet the standards for any type of comfort."
24,151,I have green sprout bibs for my infant it their too small for her neck.  She's 4 mos old. Are these bigger?,"My daughter is also 4 months old and these are a bit big on her, but I figure it's better than being too small bc she can grow into them."
24,152,Can i embroider these?,"Yes, they are perfect for monogramming."
24,153,What is the waterproof inner layer made out of?,some sort of plastic
24,154,are these machine was,Yes!
24,155,I recently saw a three-pack of GS bibs at the store and the packaging said 'organic'. Are these organic cotton? Thanks.,"The label on mine just says 75% cotton and 25% polyester. It does say PVC free, BPA free, and formaldehyde free, though."
24,156,are these bibs big for a 9 month old? I want it to cover her so she stays clean... I want a BIG TOWEL ,It fits my 9 1/2 month old well with room to spare.  It only covers baby's shirt.
24,157,Is the terry cloth rough on the face?,No it is not rough. It is like a wash cloth.
24,158,Can I use these for my new born baby from day1,"Yes. They will hang down over their legs depending on the size but it didn't bother me. My daughter was 7lbs, 10oz and 20 inches at birth and it hung at the top of her thigh. Now at six and a half months they go to her belly button. The neck will be slightly big but will still catch drool and spit up."
25,159,How wide is the walk thru opening? Would a 250lb man have to squeeze thru sideways?,18\' and my adult son who is over 400 lbs goes through fine.
25,160,Does this gate lock open?,"No. It auto swings close, unless you tie it open"
25,161,At what height is the mount?,39.4\' tall
25,162,How do you open the gate? Is there an auto open function or just manual? Is it difficult to open with someone that has arthritis in their hands? We o/,Gate is opened by slight lift and push.  There is no automated opening.  Other brands do have a foot tap opening.  Each person suffering from arthritis has different levels of function.  It would not be possible to determine whether one with arthritis could open the gate unless the level of function is known.
25,163,"The gate is advertised as 39.4\' tall, but at what height are the upper mounting points? My banister is only 39\' tall.",The upper mounting point is slightly above the gate at 39  to 40 inches. This gate won't work with your banister.
25,164,How tall is the extra tall the dreambaby extra tall gate?  How many more inches in height does the extension add?,"It is 39 or 40 inches tall.  The extension doesn't add any further height - it adds width to the gate, so that you can use it across a wider door opening."
25,165,How wide is the opening when the walk through gate is open?,19 inches
25,166,Does this gate come with a piece to keep the gate from swinging both directions when located at the top of the stairs?,"The gate opens in both directions, but latches when it swings closed so it does not swing past closed"
25,167,"Is it possible for this gate to be installed a few inches off the floor, so that our cat could crawl underneath?","Yes. However, if it on the drywall between studs you may break the drywall. Also there is an bar across the floor that would need to be stepped over. In summary, it would be possible, but rather inconvenient."
26,168,Does this work with a platform bed,"Yes, it works with my sons platform bed!"
26,169,"Which bed rail for a toddler bed? We have a crib that converts to a toddler bed when you remove one side. However, I have been unable to find any kind of bed rail to use with this? Has anyone else found a bed rail that can be used on a toddler bed? I have bought two and returned them both becuase the first thing it says on the directions is do not use with a toddler bed.","A new prodict just came on the market that can be used with convertible beds.  It's by Kidco - Kidco Wood convertible bed rail.  I just purchased it for my toddler's converted day bed and it works great!  We really love it.  I purchased it from another site and didn't have to pay shipping - look around.  One word caution, because it is a new product I has\\d a hard time finding it in any store.  So this was an online option only.  Hope this helps."
26,170,Does it work with a thick mattress to provide enough of a rail so my baby can't climb over?,"It works on a thick mattress. Ours did not climb over. It really depends, I suppose on how active your baby is. It is a deterent for sure."
26,171,need bedrail for double high mattress - sterns & foster Looking for an extra tall bedrail for an extra high mattress. Anyone use one or do I need to buy a new mattress?,I see this is an older post with no comments...did you ever find a suitable bedrail? I also have a Stearns and Foster and am worried about finding an adequate rail. Any suggestions?
27,172,Is this gate easy to open?  Would like to put at top of deck steps .,"it is flimsy, I'd not put it at the top of any stairs. Bottom, maybe."
27,173,Will this gate work in a doorway that is not completely square (old house)?,"Not much flexibility.  If you don't get a good fit, one point wont be as strong and then it is not a sturdy fit.  I noticed this with my wall.  I have a section that must be off a bit and the top two points dont reach the wall, even though the bottom points do.  It wont shut in that area."
27,174,Would a ferret be able to squeeze their way through this fence? I can't tell in the pictures how wide the spaces are.,If gate is secure with walls the animals would not be able to go through holes
27,175,Would a cat be able to jump over/jump onto this gate? I need it to keep the dogs out of the cat litter area since they think it's their treat buffet,"Odds are that a cat could jump over this gate - they're pretty agile creatures.  A dog seriously interested in getting to the \'treat\' box could probably knock down the gate as well...it's sturdy, and generally does the job of defining territory, but I wouldn't trust it for a dog on a mission..."
27,176,What is the mesh on this gate made out of -- wire or plastic?,It is made out of plastic.
28,177,Do you think this is a better option than a blender for making homemade baby food?,"No, but if you want to make soft food smoother (bananas, avacado) or take fibers out of food that are soft (strings on cooked beans, skins from cooked peas) it works well.  You'd still need a blender or food processor."
28,178,Will it puree cooked asparagus since that veggie tends to have strings that need to be removed or would the strings clog it up too fast?,If the asparagus was cooked so that is was extremely soft it prob would but I bet it would still get caught in the blades some. Worth a try.
28,179,Does the inside bottom part that pushes the food upwards go all the way to the top and push all food through? I had one that left 1/8\' food inside...,"Since there is about an \u215b\' of blade and shaft below the metal screen, there will be about an \u215b\' of food left inside at the end of the grinding process."
28,180,does this separate or strain skin or seed or bones while grinding?  Like berries or chicken?,"I don't think so, it's hard grinding soft foods like boiled vege's!"
28,181,Can it grind cooked meat?,"I tried grinding cooked ground turkey. It required a lot of \'muscle\' to push the food through. As a result, I also wound up with metal shavings in the food because the metal is too soft . I wouldn't buy this product. It's not worth the risk of metal shavings in the food."
28,182,is it easy to clean or a pain in the butt with many parts?,not too bad depends on what ya grind
28,183,can you use it on flax,I don't know
29,184,Does this work for fat women? I am a size 16/18 and the Boppy ain't happening for wide women.,"I am about the same size as you are, and found it to work wonderfully. The strap expansion had plenty of room. This was a lifesaver for my nursing woes!Also, mine was not adjustable via Velcro, it had a plastic locking clip and you could pull on the strap to tighten. I've not tried the Velcro style but think it would not be as good"
29,185,"I breastfeed using the \'football\' position, can I use MBF in this pos","Yes, I got this for my sister and she never had a problem using the \'football\' position. She said you may just need to rotate it a bit."
29,186,"Does this come with a removable, washable cover, or does that need to be ordered separately?",Mine came with a cover that can be unzipped and removed for cleaning
29,187,Is the cover 100% cotton or not?,The Deluxe is a plush polyester and the Original My Brest Friend is 100% cotton.
29,188,Is the cover removable and washable?,yes it is removable and washable
29,189,What kind of batteries are needed for this pillow & are they readily available?,"This is strictly a pillow, it has no functions requiring batteries."
29,190,breast friend vs Dr Brown,"Not familiar with Dr Brown, bought My Breast Friend for my neice.  She loved it and was very pleased with how it functioned.  I did confirm her opinion before responding"
30,191,where is it made?,Made in China
30,192,"Amazon shows a yellow warning box \'not for children under 3 years\', huh?? All the review, pics etc. seem to be for infants!","Hello, and thank you for your question on the Lamaze Musical Inchworm.  And thank you for the tip that the detail page is showing incorrect information!  This product is intended for children from birth and up.  I will work with Amazon to get the detail page updated to remove this incorrect information."
30,193,How do you clean it?,This was a gift to my grandson which he lovedI would imagine surface clean only.
30,194,my inchworm does not play the happy and you know it song. it sounds like one of j. lo's songs. is my inch worm a ,I don't like my Lamaze musical inchworm because it plays the music very faint
30,195,is this product lea,yes
30,196,Delivery time usually a few days?,Usually takes 7-12 days from China to US.
30,197,What age?,4-9 months
31,198,Does this plug-in at all or does it run just on batteries?,Just batteries.
31,199,One review mentions a mirror but I don't see one in any of the pictures.  Is there a mirror for baby to check out their reflection? (rainforest model),No there is no mirror on the rainforest model.
31,200,Does the seat adjust?,The back of the seat has 2 recline positions and the seat itself can pivot so it rocks side-to-side or front to back.
31,201,Does it have a 5 point restraint system or a 3 point?,It's 3 point.
31,202,I also need the seat cover because my puppy chewed ours up! Where can this be purchased?,"Best bet is to call Fisher Price. If they didn't help!! try buying an cheap old swing from craigslist or ebay and replace the seat cover with the one you bought (after washing it or cleaning it well) Also, if you know a good tailor, maybe he/she can sew one for you.I am just trying to give you ideas. I hope you find a new seat cover soon."
32,203,Could I use this cover with the Baby Jogger City MICRO stroller? thanks!,If you live where the weather tends to be windy and drizzly then this will absolutely be useful! It's great to keep on hand when the weather happens to turn while you are out and about too.
32,204,Will this fit City Mini GT stroller?,We have a mini GT and it fits fine. The trick is to put the shade of the mini down about halfway for the best fit.
33,205,What's the real difference between this silverado \'plus\' stoller and the skylar \'double\' stroller? Is the fact that a second infant seat can be added to the \'double\' model the only real difference between the \'double\' and \'plus\' models?  Why the price difference for basically the same stroller?,I was also wondering that...I called the company 800-328-7363. it is the second baby carseat is the only difference. i asked if the visor was bigger on the plus cuz it looks bigger...he said maybe slight but not much. i asked if either seat fully reclines - he said no. at max maybe 2 o'clock angle.
33,206,Compatible?? Has anyone used this stroller with a Chicco infant seat??,Did you ever get an answer to your question about being compatible with the Chicco infant seat?  I was wondering the same thing. Thanks!
34,207,Does it work with Britax Boulevard car seat?,We have a Britax Pinnacle car seat and it works fine.
34,208,Has anyone had success using this with the Diono Radian RXT car seat?,Sorry I don't now but my great grandsons have different car seats and it looks like the travel tray can be adjusted since it fits 2 different car seats for them. The kids had no problem setting the tray up on either car seat. Hope this helps.
34,209,Does this work with sunshine car seats?,This comes with a long adjustable strap that I'm sure canfit any car seat.  I really like it and stiil use it easy to wipe clean and keeps food off of car floor seats and in tray. My child likes it too .  He doesn't lose his cars or colors.  Enjoy
34,210,Does anyone have success using the product according to safety directions and wrapping around the child's waist NOT around the car seat?,"I only wrap it around my children's waist. It works great. I just put the pockets that hang off the sides over the arms on the seats to help hold it up a bit. Also because the tray makes using cup holders difficult, we just use a side pocket on the tray as a cup holder."
34,211,Would this work for kids in wheelchairs,It is not very wide but if you just wanted to sit on their lap and not necessarily over the arm rests it may work. Also it's not a hard enough surface for a drink to be set on without tipping but my sin liked that he could keep  his favorite snacks in the pockets on either side and he used it to color on and play with his toys in the car. Hope that helped a bit.
34,212,Will this work on a infant car seat? I have a snug fit 40 and a 7 month old who likes to play with toys in the car that fall out of reach. Thanks!,I would think that it would work. The only issue that would be a problem is that the infant seat tilts back more than a forward facing so things might roll back towards him because it tilts. However if you get it and it doesn't work for the infant seat it will definitely work for him when he's a toddler.  I have these for my 2 year old twins and they are wonderful for long car rides.
34,213,alzheimers lap tray? Would this work?,I'm not sure it would due to an adults hand and arm weight.  It is not rigid which is good for a car seat in event of impact. It can hold a book or small items (eg apple slices).  It might work - just not sure
34,214,could this work for someone in a wheelchair in th,That would depend on the size of the person. It barely fits across my daughters car seat. It's actually a bit smaller than I was expecting.
35,215,comfort,"It's comfortable if you are not a tall person, or if you like to sleep curled up. In retrospect I would have splurged for the full sized pillow."
35,216,I am 23 weeks. We are going on vacation soon. I am concerned about the number of pillows at the condo. Is it small enough to bring as a plane pillow?,It depends. I would think it's to big to bring on a plane. Are you riding in first class or coach? It's 3-4xs as big as a neck roll pillow but much smaller than the regular sized maternity pillows.
35,217,I am 5'9\'. Will this be long enough for me?,Before i purchased it I read a review stating someone way taller then me found it to fit them well but my short 5ft 2 stature think otherwise.  I found it to fit too perfectly from head to groin making me feel restricted.
35,219,Does this pillow help prevent your arm falling asleep while side sleeping?,"I had to sleep with one hand under the pillow, but sometimes it would fall asleep if not positioned well."
35,220,Has anyone found a place to purchase extra covers for this?,I have not looked; I simply washed it.
35,221,Is the cover able to be removed so that I can wash it?,"Yes.  It is not easily removed, but it is removable and washable."
35,222,is it cotton or what?,Mostly polyester and some Cotten. It is a sleeping miracle for me.
36,223,How do you keep a toddler from opening seat belt latches? I have a grandson (2.5yrs) that opens seat belt and car seats at will. Very disconcerting when you are driving alone and he climbs up front with you! Any ideas beside stapling him to the seat?,"I just stumbled acrossed your post. My youngest of four is now 11 years old.  He could unbuckle anything and everything. I went so far as to call car seat manufacturers to see if they had any ideas.  I know, I know, I felt like a terrible mother who couldn't control my own 2 year old. Every single time he unbuckled, I would pull the car over and buckle him in again. Eventually, he got the message. We had to do a lot of practice runs to go places HE wanted to go to. I just kept telling him that I would not keep driving to our destination if he wasn't \'safe and buckled\' and that I would \'drive again, when he was buckled\'.    I never let it get to a point where he was out of the seat.  Fortunately, I was able to lock the windows, so he couldn't do that to me!  Trust me, if he could have, he would have.  I'm sure by now your problem has been resolved and he has moved on to a new phase!!  Perhaps this will help someone else!"
37,224,Is it possible to use this pump in a hands-free manner?   I am hoping that i will be able to work while pumping.  Thank you.,You will need a pumping bra but it will work hands free.
37,225,how long do these pumps last?,"I used mine for over a year - as long as I kept the valves replaced regularly it worked great almost the whole time.  The last month or so I could tell the motor noise wasn't as strong as usual so I think it was on its last legs, but luckily I was past my 12-month goal so it wasn't a big deal."
37,226,Is this a quiet pump?,"It's as quiet as can be for an electric pump. It does make noise, but it isn't that loud. I whole heartedly recommend this pump.  If you're trying to pump in the middle of the night, it seems louder so I just throw a pillow over it."
37,227,How many storage bottles come with the pump?,This pump is available in different combinations. My combination had pump and 4 storage bottles with the cool case.
37,228,I'm a first time mom so very new to breast pumps - what parts of this pump do you need to wash/clean after pumping? Thanks!,"You wash the big part with the flange, the little white piece on the bottom inside the bottle and the diaphragm that goes in the top. And the bottles of course.  I usually fill a little bowl with just dishsoap and warm water and wash it right away after."
37,229,What nipples do you use on your pump bottles?,The medela ones fit. However I use avent bottles.
37,230,Is this pump compatible with milk storage bags ? Can milk be pumped directly to storage bags instead of bottles?,"I have not used the Ameda bags, but the Honeysuckle bags snapped around the base of the flanges and worked just fine for me to pump directly into bags instead of bottles - just had to be careful."
37,231,can you sterilize the parts in microwave steam steri,Yes. The instructions tells you to boil parts. I think the only part you can't is the tube.
37,232,"If my child nurses on one side, but I want to pump the other, is it possible to only pump one side with a double electric or do you HAVE to pump both?",You can disconnect the one tube so you can pump only one if you want (although I've found a manual pump is a lot easier to use while nursing at the same time!)
38,233,does this come with the bass,It turns into something similar.. The backrest. Goes all the way down... The footrest goes up and with the optional muff covers feet.. Well padded too
38,234,does this fold like an umbrella stroller or is it wide and flat?,"No, it does not fold like a regular umbrella stroller. It is indeed wide and flat."
38,235,What model year is this Red Bumbleride Flyer? How do i know i am getting the newer model..,Seller should disclose what model they are selling. I cannot tell. I knew major change from 2010 was better footrest. They had buttons on older models. 2012 had even more improvements.
39,236,Is it electric?,"You can plug it in and when you unplug it, it runs on batteries and the battery is rechargeable. Absolutely love these monitors"
39,237,Are there two pieces to this?,Yes. There is a receiver and a transmitter.
39,238,Is it a monitor or only the reciever,It is both the monitor and the receiver.
39,239,"This picture shows just the receiver, does this come along with a monitor too at the same","Yes - you get both items.  Please understand that it is not two way - you can listen to one location from another location, but not the other direction."
39,240,Can I use two of these in the same house without interference? Can I use two of these in the same house without interference?,"KC is correct - I bought two sets (so one transmitters and one receiver in each set) to see what would happen if I set up two transmitters (in adjacent rooms) to broadcast on the same channel. The receiver ends up picking up only one of the two transmitters at a time, and sometimes, unpredictably, noisily flips back and forth between them. If you want to use two of these transmitters at the same time, you'll need to set them to different channels."
39,241,Cordless monitor anyone have experience with a monitor that the part by the baby is cordless...??  I can take the cord on the listening part but need the part in baby bed to be cordless..any answers,The part that goes in the baby's room is NOT cordless.  I own 2 of these.  Only the parent's side of the monitor has the cordless option.
39,242,"if you got 2 sets of these, would you be able to monitor 2 rooms on the same rec","Yes, just set the color selectors to the same on both."
39,243,Can I buy two of these and use the same receiver?,This comes with a monitor and a receiver. Picture doesn't show. But it does. So if you buy two of what's shown you'll get 2 receivers too. As long as you are on the same frequency on the receive you can use as many monitors as you want with one receiver.
39,244,Is this monitor analog or digital?,This is an analog monitor.
40,245,Is the hardware metal or plastic?,the hardware is plastic
40,246,Can this be folded and stored easily when not in use?  I will just need it one day a week for my grandson.  Was worried about metal play yard weight.,Yes I fold it in and out every day for my pups - this is wood not metal - and everyone that come into my house loves it and is ordering them in fact I have to order another one THX for reminding me.  kat
40,247,how long is it?,Each panel is 2 feet.
40,248,"Hi, can I join 2 of these North States Superyard 3 in 1 Wood Gates to make an extra large play area? Will I need to purchase additional extensions ( other than the 2 Superyards) to do so? Thanks.","You can put 2 of these together as Carolyn and some other reviewers have said, however Carolyn's math is quite a bit off.  I went and figured it out myself.  A hexagon with 2ft sides is a little over 10 square feet, as it says.  Adding the 2 panel extension makes it an octagon, which would be slightly more than 19 square ft, also as stated.  The difference is that combining 2 yards would have 12 panels and be a dodecagon, which would be about 44.8 square feet.  You'd have to get 3 sets of extensions to equal the same area, since all the sides are 2ft in length.  The extensions currently cost 52.14, which is 156.42.  The playyard itself is 155.96.  Thus you are getting a better deal with 2 playyards.  Not only is it slightly cheaper, it also gives you an extra door panel.  That means it's more adaptable for using as 2 separate gates if you want to at some point."
40,249,Is this item easy to put out and take down on a daily basis? we got the plastic north states play yard and it take a lot of effort to close it up.,"It's probably fairly easy to do on a daily basis.  You'd have to turn the bars between each gate to loosen it up, then take one bar out and then fold it up like an accordion."
40,250,What is the gap distance between vertical bars? Are they spaced closely enough to contain a cat?,"Just eyeballing it -- maybe a little over 2 inches between bars.  I don't think a full-grown cat would be able to squeeze through; a small kitten maybe could.  I think the height would be more of the question for using it to contain a cat.  If your cat is like a kitten I had, it wouldn't be unrealistic for it to jump to the top of the gate, perch there, and then jump off to where ever it wants to go!!  :) That's speculating -- I haven't actually used it with a cat...!!"
40,251,is this a babby,Yes.
40,252,pet pen?,We used it for our dog as a pen when he was a puppy.  It is now used as a barrier sometimes.
40,253,How many extensions can be added?,I don't think there is a limit.
40,254,Can this be spilt to create two three panel gates?,"Yes it can, but 3 panels will be a little more tippy with only 3 panels"
41,255,Can these nipples be steam cleaned in the microwave ?,Yes. I sterilized them in microwaveable bags many times.
41,256,My baby is exclusively breastfed. I am looking for a bottle that mimics the breast. Will this nipple flow be good for my 8 month old or too slow?,"The flow in this is really slow, I had to put a little slit to the top of the nipple to allow for a faster flow as my baby was getting frustrated"
41,257,What would you recommend for a 7-10 month old?,No. Flow too slow. At ~5-6 months we switched to Avent Natural.
41,258,What stage for 4 month old,A four month old would typically be in the stage 2 which is for 3-6 months.  The hole in the nipple is a little larger than the stage one allowing a faster flow.   Hope this helps!!
41,259,How is the stage 2 nipple?  Is it a pretty fast flow or is it still conservative (to mimic the breast)?,It's very conservative to mimic your breast flow. It's just for baby when the pull becomes stronger say about 3/4 months.
41,260,Is this stage 2 nipple a variable speed?,"No, its not...that's why there are different stages of nipples."
42,261,what kind of proudcts do this package include?,"It comes with three small bottles, one bigger bottle and one big sippy cup. It also has stage one and two flow nipples. All the parts are inter-changeable meaning when you start baby on sippy cups you can put the handle and sippy cup top on the smaller bottle or if you need another large bottle you can put a nipple on the sippy cup. When you baby is done with bottles you can buy the sippy cup tops seperatly and use them on the a containers as well wich will give you more mileage out of your original purchase."
42,262,does this set come with a bottle brush?  There's no detail of what is inc,No bottle brush included but I suggest purchasing the Avent brush!
42,263,best bottles for newborns not being breastfed? what are the best bottles for newborns not being breast fed? (infant being adopted),I have had the best luck with born free. They are BPA free and work great with babies with or without reflux issues.
43,264,does the chico keyfit 30 use this ad,I don't know.  We bought the one on the Phil &Ted;'s website
43,265,Does this work with the Graco snug ride CLICK connect...not classic connect?,"im not sure i know the difference, if i were to guess i would say it works with both... heres what i have and it works great https://www.google.com/search?q=graco+quattro+tour+travel+system&rls;=org.mozilla:en-US:official&tbm;=isch&tbo;=u&source;=univ&sa=X&ei;=-kKnUqW3FbSzsQSg6YDQCA&ved;=0CH0QsAQ&biw;=1020&bih;=638#facrc=_&imgdii;=_&imgr;c=RNfdVkVfQUecmM%3A%3BCUhS3Xuy14D2pM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.babygiftsoutlet.com%252Fimages%252Flarge%252Fgraco-quattro-tour-travel-system-stroller-nouvelle_BG00473.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.babygiftsoutlet.com%252Fprd%252Fgraco-quattro-tour-travel-system-zurich.html%3B550%3B550 if hte link doesnt work its the car seat from the graco quatro tour nouvelle travel system... hope this helps"
43,266,"i have a Graco  snug ride 30, is it going to",Hi! I have the Chicco key fit 30.  I tried all the travel systems and the one that ended up working VERY well for us was the one with the red balls and straps.  Good luck!!!
44,267,How do you keep a toddler from opening seat belt latches? I have a grandson (2.5yrs) that opens seat belt and car seats at will. Very disconcerting when you are driving alone and he climbs up front with you! Any ideas beside stapling him to the seat?,"I just stumbled acrossed your post.

I'm sure by now your problem has been resolved and he has moved on to a new phase!!  Perhaps this will help someone else!"
45,268,WHAT DOES THE HYPO DO?,"Assuming you mean \'hippo\' instead of \'hypo\', there is actually no hippo on this jumperoo, it's an \'Old McDonald\' theme so there's piggies, a cat, a cow, ducks, a horse, a vegetable garden and a chicken. The Cow turns around if you move it, the blue horse pops up from behind the fence when you push a button, the vegatables light up when you put them in their correct spots, the ducks spin around, when you push one pig down, the others pop up, etc. It's a great toy, simply adorable, we aren't farm people but just loved this theme for our daughter but it's very gender neutral. It plays farm songs and lights up. I also liked that it was adjustable for as my daughter grew."
45,269,is this a walke,no
45,270,Must babies be able to hold their heads up completely for them to use this? Or will their head be somewhat supported if it's still a tad wobbly?,Yes.  Babies should be able to hold their head up.  There is not enough support for a wobbly head.
45,271,Does it fold?,No! You will have to detach the top from the base.
45,272,I'd like to wash the seat.  Is it removable?,Yes you can take the seat out and wash it! It's machine washable!!!!
45,273,Are the vegetables rattles?.,"One of them, the yellow corn rattles"
45,274,"Some of the pictures show a round base, some show triangluar. I prefer the round base. which is this base? round or.triangle ?",mine is a triangle-not sure what the base shape would affect???
45,275,It appears the top is fairly low; will the child hit their,No
45,276,can it be disassembled to carry during t,Yes it can be disassembled for travel or storage.
46,277,How wide is door?,"46.25 inches wide, would this gate work for us?"
46,278,"The gate is advertised as 36\' tall, but at what height are the upper mounting points?  My banister is only 35\' tall.",The upper mounting points are 34\' tall.  You have one inch to spare.  The arch on the gate is 36\' tall.
46,279,How large are the wide openings at the bottom of the gate?  I have cats and don't want them to slip through.,The widest opening is about 4.5in wide and 2in high. I have 2 cats and neither of them slip through...even though it was funny to watch one of them try
46,280,What is the width of the walk through gate itself (the opening the people walk through)?,"from latch to latch, mine is measuring 16 1/2 inches"
46,281,What is the distance between the bars please?,The distance between the bars varies. In the main body the widest distance is 2 1/4\'  near the floor the wider openings are 4 1/4\' at the widest point.
46,282,This gate only swings open one way? Or both ways?,Only swings one way.
46,283,"Mine does not automatically shut, ever, and it also does not require use of the button on top to open it.  Is there something wrong with it?",At first I thought my gate wasn't very baby proof as I didn't need to use the button on top to open it. I just had to lift up and it opened. It also didn't swing close and lock itself. You need to make the gate tighter. You will notice a little lip hanging off the button on top. That is what is suppose to stop the gate from being able to just be lifted upwards and open. If your gate is at the correct fit to the door way it should swing close and lock itself. I hope this helps.
46,284,Do the mounting knobs adjust enough to account for baseboards?  Our opening is an inch or two narrower at the bottom than the top.,Yes knobs screw into the gate so you can adjust the bottom different then the top! Ours is the same way as far as base boards go :)
46,285,Can additional sections be ordered so the gate can be used in a wider space?,"There is another similar gate amazon has listed as \'frequently bought together\' that is up to 6 feet wide, I would think that is the one you want."
47,286,What is the age range for this gift?,The package says 3+m
47,287,"The product description say \'NO\' under batteries required, I assume this is not correct. What size and how many?",It came with two AA batteries it said were only for demonstration. We haven't changed them yet.
47,288,what are the tunes,It's perfect!
47,289,Does it play the entire piece or just a segment of it ?,The entire piece! This is a great toy because of the music and the lights
47,290,"Baby Einstein Takealong Tunes...Is it TOXIC? I was wanting something to round out my order with Amazon last week, ya know, to get the free shipping deal.  I found what looked like a perfect item.  Baby Einstein's Takealong Tunes.  I was looking at the product info and found a statement that said something to the effect of they are required to notify the consumer of Proposition 65 (this was a link).  I clicked on the link and it took me another statement that said something like the product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer or repoductive harm.  I couldn't believe it!  I emailed Baby Einstein and they forwarded my email to the maker of the toy and I got back this response:I want to assure you that Kids II products are safe. Our products are latex free and paint materials are non-toxic. Our products meet and pass necessary requirements for phthalates, PVC's and BPA's. In addition to the tests that are performed by both U.S. and International standards, we also perform testing and go through extra safety procedures with parents and children within our local area. Not only do our products meet the requirements they are also certified by the accredited independent laboratories mentioned with Intertek and Bureau Veritas. In being a private company I hope that you will understand that we are unable to provide specific details on the materials within the products. However in being parents ourselves, we want to share the same confidence with you that we have in allowing our children to play with our products. In other words...they refused to tell me exactly what the warning was pertaining to!  I wrote back for further clarification and haven't received a response.  Today, about a week and a half later and they have now REMOVED the link to the warning!!!  What's going on?  Is this toxic or isn't it???http://www.oehha.org/prop65.htmlAny info would be appreciated!  Thanks.Nadine","Thanks for your reply.  If the product is safe then why the warning?  It cited Prop 65.  If you click on the link it comes up with:\'Proposition 65Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in November 1986. The Proposition was intended by its authors to protect California citizens and the State's drinking water sources from chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals.Proposition 65 requires the Governor to publish, at least annually, a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\'I contacted the Office of Environmental Health Hazzard Assessment and they said that the manufacturer is responsible for keeping track of chemicals that they include in their products that are considered toxic and informing the consumer of those chemicals.  They DID inform the consumer, right on the Amazon website, but after I questioned the warning they REMOVED it!  If the toxic part is inside the toy then that isn't as big of a deal and I would buy it anyway.  If it's outside then I feel that I have the right to know.  I asked the manufacturer this and they still have yet to answer.  I don't understand what all the secrecy is about.  Thanks again for your reply.~Nadine"
47,291,"Is it supposed to be this quiet? I just bought this as a present and it was so quiet even set on the loudest setting that I thought perhaps the batteries needed replacing. So I opened it up and replaced the batteries but it's still so quiet I have to hold it up to my ear to hear it. I'm thinking there must be something wrong because with it so quiet on the loud setting, what would one need an even quieter setting?","It is not that quiet on loud, but not terribly loud either. You should not have to hold it to your ear on loud, although it is not as loud as many toys (which is why it is more tolerable to everyone else in the room or car who have to hear it over and over!)"
47,292,does it play continously? no batteries...what makes i,"No, it doesn't. It has a few short songs. It has batteries."
47,293,Age,from a few months to infinity
47,294,But what battery(s) does it use?? When battery use products are shown for sale it should ALWAYS indicate what battey(s) they use for their operation! Why the secrecy about this?,"Batteries included? If not, I need to ship some along with the gift."
47,295,What is age,9 months to 2 years
48,296,Does this fit with a regular citi mini single stroller? (not GT version)Does it fit with the double citi mini gt? Can you fold it up when not in use?,I don't know about the citi mini because I have a Valco stroller.  You CAN fold it up when not in use as it clips into a strap that you attach to the handles of the stroller.  This strap/clip piece did break after about a month or so in use (gravity takes a toll if you keep it in this position) but we were able to jury rig it back together.
48,297,Does this fit the Britax B ready stroller? Thank you!,Yes.  There's a way to attach it to the stroller  both single or double setting.  It took me a while to figure it out but it does attach to it.  It will attach to the main frame of the stroller if your using just a single seat.  It will attach to the second seat frame if you're using the  second seat.
48,298,Will it fit a Britax B Agile Stroller?,"I can't guarantee 100% that it will, but I think it would. This accessory is VERY adjustable - the part that hooks to the downward struts is an adjustable strap, and beyond that the length of the arms running down to the accessory are also adjustable, so it can adapt to many sizes of stroller. Looking at the image online, I'd say it would fit it."
48,299,Does it fit the Jeep Urban Terrain Stroller?,"The hitchhiker is a great product -- very well built & quite adjustable, so I could see that it might fit.  Keep in mind that you'll need headroom for your child to stand, so if you have a full handlebar (not 2 separate handles, open in between), that may indeed be your limiting factor.  In that case, if you could remove your 'parent tray', there may be enough room for your toddler to stand & put their head through."
48,300,Does it fit a double stroller,"Yes, on a side by side... and it should fit most front to back doubles since they are the same width as a single stroller (though that might be hard to steer).On a side by side double stroller there are 3 legs on the back for the wheels. You attatch the Hitch Hiker to one of the outside legs and the middle part. That leaves the space behind the other seat for you to walk. The standing child will need to hold on to the bar in front of them. Occasionally for really sharp turns you'll need to reach around the child and grab the outside handles to make the turn, but for most walking and steering, I've found that just holding onto the open space is enough.On our Combi double stroller we leave the attatchment brackets on the back legs to fold it up, but we do remove the Hitch Hiker board itself every time. It only takes a few seconds to snap in and out of the brackets."
48,301,does it come with ,No
48,302,"Can the child sit on this board as well as stand? Also, any idea if it would fit an InStep Safari in-line double jogger?",My kid would sit on it but it's not safe. She also had to either sit cross legged so her feet wouldn't drag or she would place her feet onto the bars of the MacClaren. I don't know the stroller you are referring to but the board is really adjustable in regard to width & arm length. You just need to make sure to have two clear bars (about 2\' of space) to attach the arms to it. My friend used this with her city mini double stroller and it was fine. Hope this helps!
49,303,I am looking for is a seat that reclines for a 4-month old to sit in front of the TV and feed him...thought this might work. Does anyone think it wil?,"It has to be attached to a dining chair to work. It does not stand on its own on the floor. It does recline nicely, I would recommend it if you want to move a dining chair to the living room with the baby."
49,304,Does this chair recline enough for a newborn baby?,"ummm....well to answer your question, i don't think you should put a newborn in a booster seat! probably from about 3 months onwards! but i'll have to say no to your question, it won't! but it's an excellent booster seat! better than the fisher price brand on account of space and economically! it's strong and works really well!"
49,305,I am looking to use this for my 5 1/2 month old granddaughter..I would like to use it without the tray at the table. Has anyone done this.,"I have done so.  However, depending upon the height of the table, it won't push all the way under.  The tray is really the safest thing for a child that young.  I didn't start taking the tray off until my grandson was around 15 months old.  The center bar and belts will hold her in good enough, just be careful."
49,306,Are there a bunch of crevices under the pad where food can get stuck?,"No, the actual set portion detaches quite easily to allow for proper cleaning. We don't use the pad because it made it more time consuming to clean when our son gets messy"
49,307,"Our chairs do not have slots in the back. There is a space between the bottom and the back rest, but no slots. Will this still work?","Yes, you do not need any slots as the straps go around the back and bottom of the chair"
49,308,I just bought this seat and the back won't click into place either. What's the trick?,"Hi Helena, I guess theres no trick...too much of muscle power..I had this problem, i somehow forced it into the base and it is stuck forever now i guessthe two side bars went inside the middle one is out...but its locked"
50,309,is there compatibility with Bob Strolle,I have both a BOB and uppababy and it only fits on the uppababy.
50,310,does this fit on the uppababy ,"No, the frame is different on the g-luxe. This will only work on the vista."
50,311,"Is the UPPAbaby \'PiggyBack Ride Along Board\' compatible with the UPPAbaby G-Luxe stroller, or only the Visa?","The Piggyback does not work on the G-luxe or G-lite umbrella strollers. Currently, it is only available for the Vista but there will be one available soon for the Cruz."
50,312,Has anyone gate checked their Vista with this Piggyback board attached?,Yes!! It worked out perfectly!! I have a 1 yr old and 3 yr old and the piggyback was a lifesaver at the airport.
50,313,is this compatible with the 2015 uppababy ,"No, the one called 'older version' is for 2014 and earlier models. You'd need the other Piggy Back Ride Along which will specifically say 2015 model."
50,314,is this complatible with  the 2012,"Yes, it worked really well on our 2012 Vista"
50,315,does this work with uppababy cruz,No they have two separate ones.. One for the vista and one for the Cruz.. It snaps on and folds up nice.. U have to look up piggyback for Cruz ..
50,316,Does it fit with the stroller in the vista travel bag?,"Yes, if you detach it (easy), it pretty easily folds inside the stroller."
50,317,is it compatible with maclaren stro,It was designed for UppaBaby. Not that I know of.
51,318,Price difference Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle SwingHas anyone noticed the $100 price difference if you order this from Amazon? Any insight as to why that may be?,"The Amazon product says it requires batteries, while the one straight from Fisher-Price says it can plug in. I don't know if the price increase is because they changed the product, or if the product description on one site or the other is wrong - but maybe that is why the price is different."
51,319,Can the feet be taken off the seat so I  can use it just as a seeing and eliminate some bulk? Thanks.,I would be worried it would knock the balance off- I went downstairs and put mine upside down and looked at it- I think (think) you could but I don't know that I would do that- maybe look for a different swing? Sorry :(  however Amazon has a great return policy so you could always buy it and assemble and if you don't like send back.
51,320,"Does the seat do anything when not attached to the motor? Like, bounce, move, anything?",It is on spring like things so it bounces when the baby moves around. My husband and I like to use our feet as we multitask :-)
51,321,does the removable cradle vi,It does not. It's pretty much just a baby seat.
51,322,Does the swing come with the adapter or not?  I read conflicting feedback.,"When I purchased it, it came with the cord."
51,323,can we remove blanket...if we do not wa,It is attached on both sides...they overlap with each other when folded in. Unless you removed the stitching then no unfortunately....
51,324,I am a bit confused about the noise of this swing. It is anything other than \'quiet\'. Is there a trick to it?,Ours isn't that loud so I don't know what else to suggest to you. Maybe make sure things are tight but not too tight. If the legs are fully stretched out to the side it helps too.
51,325,Is the button to change the speed manual/loud for a sleeping baby?,It's a nob for speed and a little switch for the volume
51,326,How old was your baby when they outgrew this swing?,We used it for a few months. It could have held her up until now (she is a year old) but we mostly used it from when she was born until 4 months of age. It is a little pricey but when you have a baby that is soothed by the swing its priceless :) I resold mine for half what I paid.
51,327,Does this swing have any kind of restraint or harness? Or is the blanket the only thing keeping baby from falling out?,"YES!!! The blanket just covers the harness. Makes it look pretty, but if your kid is anything like mine was, she loved to kick her legs up and play with her feet so the \'cover\' spent most of its time to the side. :)"
52,328,Measurements? I was wondering if anyone has the actual opening measurements of the toddler seat? I want to make sure my duaghter will not fall in and also are there any problems with the seats falling down? Thanks:),7 and 7.5 inch oval. 7 in wide. 7.5 in long.the hole is pushed forward. should fit small children.big kids may be less comfortable.
52,329,Can this be used for 1 1/2 year old with a stool? or is it to big?,"Yes, you could use it with an 18-month-old, if you could get them on the potty somehow."
52,330,Does this have top mounting hinges or doesn't it need to be screwed in from the bottom to fit the toilet?,This type has hinges on the top.  This is per my plumber son-in-law.   Great seat if you have potty training to do.
52,331,How well does this seat work for little boys sitting down?  Do they end up spraying though and getting the floor and their clothes all wet?,"Unfortunately yes, my son when sitting down sprays between the seats, and it spills over on toilet bowl unto floor. It's become habit to have wipes near toilet to clean up. Rarely has his clothes got wet from sitting down, it just spills over on bowl, just missing his pants.  For my daughter is was perfect, we had no issues. They both felt comfortable and safe on the smaller seat and we were able to use the adult seat for us or our guests."
53,332,I've been washing these along with my cloth diapers and they are getting rough and scratchy! I'm very surprised! Anyone else have this happen?,Yes. We ended up throwing ours away. We love the Charlie Banana wipes that have fleece on one side.
53,333,What are the dimentions of the flannel wipes,"Not sure what they were prior to first wash/dry, but mine are now roughly 5-6\' square."
53,334,What are these wipes made of? 100% cotton?,"Yep, 100% cotton."
53,335,"Can you use these for washcloths, too, or only for wipes? They seem very soft!","yes, you can use them for either. I found they had a musty smell for a while. I still use them a year later and they stopped smelling musty. I also use them as sudo paper towels/wipes to clean up during meal times."
53,336,What are the actual measurements of the wipes?,I don't have the exact measurements. But they are the same size as baby wash cloths and the same width. They are between 6-7\' square. I like them except they smelled really musty when wet at first. They don't anymore.
54,337,Does this snap in on its own onto the Baby Jogger City Mini GT or do I need to but an adapter to make it work?,"It snaps on directly into the Jogger. The Bar has two adapters, one on each end, they slot into the appropriate location on the jogger, and the docking/undocking buttons are already on the jogger. You press the buttons to remove it, but it slides in and locks automatically. Very convenient when trying to place a sleeping child into the jogger.Two buttons on each side allow you to adjust the height of the bar.The bar is also strong enough for carrying the jogger. I just put it on my shoulder as you would a shoulder bag."
54,338,Has anyone used this in place of the infant car seat adapter? I would like to use it with my Graco click connect 35...,I use it with my graco 35 it's tight fit! But it won't fall out! And I would buy it again;)
54,339,Do I need to buy two for the citi mini side by side double stroller?,"No, You need a double belly bar. (separate product..)"
54,340,Will this work on a Chicco Liteway Stroller?,I would guess not! The bar is made for this exact Baby Jogger stroller.
54,341,Will this belly bar fit the Summit X3?,Yes
54,342,Does this fit  Mountain Buggy Nano stroller? thanks!,Yes
55,343,"The description does not mention the mattress, does it come with it, and if it did did the description at the time say i",The crib does come with a mattress however I never saw anything that said it did so I ordered a mattress as well and had to return it afterwards.
55,344,Does this mini crib have more than one mattress level?,"No, just the one lower level (that is safe for teeny tiny babies and older babies that can pull themselves us and stand).  This is a portable crib so all (but the mattress) are in one connected piece.  You fold it out for set-up, and fold it in to put it away.  The mattress base (board) is hinged on one side of the crib and it gets laid down to rest on the lip of the crib sides (they also have 3 Velcro straps for extra security), and then to put the crib away you take out the mattress and pull up this hinged base board and it rests against one of the crib sides in storage.  Ends (of the crib) are hinged on the top and bottom middle and are pulled in (or pushed out) for set-up or storage.  (There are also two safety latches on the inside bottom ends to keep the crib extra secure.)  Set-up and break down doesn't even a minute to do.  It has HEAVY DUTY (hard) rubber wheels to roll the crib around on.  This bed is narrow enough to push through doors even when set-up.  I love this crib.  One purchase I've never had a thought of regret about!!  Quality, heavy duty product you would expect from the craftsmanship of years ago (when it wasn't so much about commodity, but producing a quality piece that you would be proud of)."
55,345,How thick is the mattress that comes with the crib?  What size sheets fit this matress?,3\' mattress.  Mini-crib sheets.
55,346,What is the maximum weight for the baby?,I don't know.  I have my grandson in it at 24 pounds and it does just fine.  He won't fit much longer as he is getting too long for the bed.
56,347,Will these fit the Nuby active cup (10 ounce)?,"My son has this kind of cup and they fit them..Nuby 2 Pack No Spill Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May VaryHope that helps :)"
56,348,will these fit the nuby natural ,i checked the product out and it looks like it might fit the Natural Touch 3 Stage Feeding System 8 ounces. the natural sport sipper wont cause they look thin.
56,349,Can these fit the munchkin trainer cup,I would say no because it's a different brand.  See if there are munchkin replacements.
56,350,Do these fit the Nuby Click It Grip'n'Sip?,"Hi Sarah.. I believe there are different versions of those cups, if there full round it may work... take a look of the little bumps the plastic cap has... this one has 2 wholes to fit with to bumps... some others caps has 3 and it there is your case... may have some leakage issues ;) I hope that this helps"
57,351,"Contours Tandem VS City Min? We are trying to figure out what stroller we should get for our newborn and 21 month old... I think we have it narrowed down to the countours tandem and the city mini. We are looking for something that is durable, easy to lift in & out of my SUV, something that can handle both dirt paths and sidewalks and something that can go in & out of stores easily.  Are we looking for the impossible?  I love that the children can face each other in the countours, but I worry about the bulk and it's ability to navigate snowy walkways.  My husband thinks we need something with bigger wheels, like a jogger stroller, but I find them to be too heavy.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","Hi.  We have had both strollers.  We started with the Contours Tandem.  I liked all the variations and options it seemed to have, especially that the carseats could go directly onto the stroller (we bought the extra attachment).  Unfortunately, by about 6 months I was feeling like it was so difficult to maneuver and was somewhat cumbersome.  We were going to travel by airplane and didn't feel it would be able to travel with us because of it's size/weight etc.  We ended up buying the City Mini and have LOVED it.  It is much easier to fold, put into and out of vehicles.  It fits better as it folds in half instead of upright, which is how the Contours folds, which then needs to be turned on it's side to put into the car.  The mini can be pushed, turned, maneuvered in almost any way with just one hand!  It has fit through all but one door in a very old building.  It has traveled with us many times and we couldn't live without it.  Our twins are now 19 months old and will be able to use it for quite some time (as our 5 year old occasionally wants to be strolled in it, I know there is lots of growing room). While the Contours has so many great ideas (seat positions etc.) it was just too hard to handle.  I would highly recommend the City mini to anyone with a need for a double stroller.  We LOVE it!"
57,352,Compatible Infant Car Seats? We have a Chicco Keyfit Infant Car Seat (part of the travel system) and hope that the Kolcaft Contours Tandem Stroller is compatible.  Does anyone know for sure?,I have twins and use two Chicco Keyfit 30 infants seats (with a separately purchased extra carseat adapter). The two seats fit just fine and don't touch each other.
57,353,Is this stroller okay for light jogging?,Light jogging yes. It's  not a full on runner.
57,354,Contours Tandem Stroller- easy to travel with? I will be traveling alone with twins (a lot) and will need to have the stroller placed under the aircraft at the gate.  Will I really have to take the second seat out to close the stroller?  Will it be too much to deal with? Thanks!,"Yes, you will really need to remove the second seat.  It can be a bit of a pain, but it does get easier with practice.  I'd be concerned about the seat getting lost, though.  There is a strap to secure the removed seat to the folded stroller, but it jars loose in my van - I can't imagine that it'd stay put in an airplane.  While I love this stroller, I really wouldn't want to take it on a plane."
57,355,does anyone know who makes a rain cover that would fit the Kolcraft options tandem stroller? We have the one from Babies-r-us and it doesn't fit.  I called Kolcraft and they had no  answer for me.  Any suggestions?,dont get just one. get two for single strollers. i have this stroller and i just have two raincovers. because if you have one facing forward and one facing the parent those big raincovers wont work. get single ones!
57,356,"seating in a doublestroller we are very happy with our sit-n-stand, but it is after all this time about to be retiered. I still like to have the older child closer to me when I push because it makes it so much easier to controll the stroller. Are there other tandem stroller out there that let me do that as well? How about the \'Contours Options Tandem Stroller\' ? Can the infant car seat adopter be placed in the front seat position?","Yes, I believe it can. There are so many options, hence the name. Check on YouTube for videos of the stroller and I think you'll have this confirmed."
57,357,How would I know its Kolcraft Options Plus the new model ? so there is new and a old model. New is known as Options Plus whereas the old is just Kolcraft Optionns Tandem.I bought the new one but the box does not have th Plus word on it. Did I get a old one?,Apparently the Options Plus versions (with the I-Pod dock) aren't being sold right now and won't be again until the first of next year. Does anyone know where I can get one with the I-Pod dock...preferably in the orange color? I would be willing to buy one second hand if I could just find one!!!
57,358,"Doesn't anyone elses kid drink or snack on the ride? Why is everyone so positive and happy about the fact that this stroller has two cup holders for the driver (and an iPod deck in the Plus model), and no one, in their complaints, mentions the fact that THERE IS NO CUP HOLDER FOR THE KIDS!!  At least not in the pictures. If you own this and it DOES have that PLEASE post that information. Because that is the make it or break it deal for me.  I have two boys, and no they CAN\'T just hold their snack cup or sippy while riding, they like to do other things with their hands and when they tire of holding a cup they throw it down if they have nowhere to put it. I'm AMAZED that no one seems to miss this feature on this stroller.  I will not buy it if it doesn't have that, I hate to be constantly leaning around to hand them stuff. My overall comfort is based on knowing they can help themselves.","As I have been looking at strollers, I too have noticed that it does not have any cup holders for the children. But, the newer version, \'twilight\' (the blue/gray version) does have 2 mesh pockets inside each seat. Not ideal, but it's better than nothing."
58,359,"Is the Potty Time Potty Watch water proof? As in, if the child gets it wet when washing hands or playing outside will the watch be ok?","I don't think it is water proof. Not really sure, but I know my son subjected his watch to rough play and it still works."
58,360,How do you turn it off so the timer doesn't go off all night long?,Press both the timer and side set button at the same time just like when setting it. Just don't press anything again after.
58,361,How do you turn it off so the timer doesn't go off all night long?,You have to set it to off and then reprogram it to the time interval you want again each morning.
58,362,"Is it loud enough to wake them at night? He's fine during the day, its the night we can't break",Even if it were I didn't let her wear it at night. An alarm can't make me get up on time so if my child is really sleepy I wouldn't expect them to get up. Just make sure you have them go potty before you go to sleep not them. They should be goodThrough thr night.
58,363,Is this watch actually effective?What happens when they no longer have the watch?Do they learn to go potty w/o it and not over-rely on it?Thank you.,"I hot not 1 but 2 (yes, TWO) defective watches. They are cute and have multiple song alarms, but they suck the expensive batteries dry in less than 24 hours. I think kds like it because it gives them control over when they go (not a parent constantly instructing). We switched to a cheap lady bug kitchen timer that my daughter loved, though even at 3\u00bd when playing she needs reminders to take a potty break."
58,364,How big is the main part of the watch?  I'm trying to figure out if it would be too big for my 16mo old,"It works for my 20 month old, but it is very cheaply made!"
58,365,How do you change the batteries?,"I took it apart to change the batteries, it's hard but it is do-able."
58,366,Is there a way to turn the sound on?  Currently the lights just go on and off.  Not sure if it's defective or I'm missing somehing.,"Mine came with the sound working, so that seems like it would be a defect."
58,367,How do you turn it on? This is my 2nd watch and the blue button activates nothing?,Hold the side button and the timer button at the same time! The battery might be dead b/ c the battery only lasted about 2 weeks on the one I bought!
58,368,I am concerned that my 2 year old will enjoy pushing the buttons and mess up all the timer settings.... Did anyone else run into this problem?,"My son is all about buttons and he never managed to mess up the settings. You have to push the main button and the other buttons in sequence to change the settings. I wouldn't worry. This watch was a life saver for my son. I thought he was never going to get it, but the watch worked like a charm."
59,369,Is the bottom non-skid?,"No not exactly. The entire thing has the same surface covering. I would compare it to if you covered fabric with the plastic from a milk carton. It does slide around a little. You are supposed to bolt it to the dresser etc. We have used it 2 years no problems, and we have a pretty wily kiddo."
59,370,Can this be screwed to a dresser or changing table?  Many we looked at came with a piece to screw it on and the two sided one we have did not.,"Yes, we haven't done this with ours but it comes with the stuff to do so."
59,371,The Naturapedic covers are pricey. Can you recommend an alternative changing pad cover that fits this well?,"Haven't tried anything else, the Naturpedic is pricey but worth the price. It has held up like new, still fits perfectly and gets softer ever time it's washed. When it's in the wash we just use the pad with a normal cover."
59,372,Any benefit or drawback to getting the 4-sided vs the 2-sided?,"If your baby turns into a tall toddler, his/her feet will be able to extend past the two-sided pad. The head and feet sides might be uncomfortable at that point."
60,373,are these the ones that you can sterilise in the micr,"Yes they are. You can sterilize them in the microwave on their own, no sterilizing tub needed."
60,374,are these the ones that you can sterilise in the micr,Yes. You don't need anything extra. You just set up the bottles a certain way. There are instructions in the package.
60,375,what the nipple size of this package?,Size 1
61,376,Does it work with tommee tippee bottles?,I assume it would.  I used Dr Browns and Avent.
61,377,Can you use it to warm up formula?,"Yes, you can use it for formula or breastmilk. On the package it even mentions using it to warm baby food in jars."
61,378,Would this be safe to use on the lowest setting to warm baby lotion bottles? Or is even the lowest setting too hot for that purpose?,"Yes it will, but it depends on weather you use cold or warm water to heat the bottle. We used cold water and heated the bottle, but had to re-heat it, then re-heat again. Now we know that if we use cold water to heat the baby bottle we use the three setting and it is just right. I hope this helps you."
61,379,Do Medela 5 oz bottles fit?,"so far, every bottle or food container I've ever used has fit in here - it's pretty wide but avent does best of course"
61,380,Can I leave this plugged in and turned on (set to just below dial setting #2)?  Thank you.,I probably wouldn't.  I think the water would evaporate quickly.  I only use it when I'm heating the bottle and I'm constantly filling it with water.
61,381,freevolt???? korea use 220v,"I bought it for my relative in Russia, they also  use 220v. I ve sent a converter as well. You can buy it in a travel or electronic store. Specification on http://www.usa.philips.com/c/avent-baby-preparing-for-feeding/110v-scf260_33/prd/en/ says it is 110v."
61,382,CAn you heat Medela storage bottles in this?,"If they're BPA free, I think you can."
61,383,Do the Breast Milk Storage cups fit here?,"Yes they do, the round bottle top comes off and the hole is larger to hold the express milk cups."
61,384,Will this fit 1) Avent newer Natural style bottles 2) wider bottles from other brands like Tommee Tippee? thanks!,It does fit Avent Natural. It will fit Tommee Tippee if you take the basket out.
61,385,Hello! What is the voltage? 12v or 220v?,120 vlt.
62,386,Where can I get a replacement battery for the Avent DECT parent piece? I have a Phillips Avent SCD510 which I am trying to find replacement rechargeable battery for the parent unit.  Please help.  Thank you.  P.S.  It has lasted about 2 years.,I called them as my unit is also 2 years old and the parent unit spontaneously turn off. I have to keep not plugged in all the time. They referred me to philipsparts.com where I can buy a new battery for 28$  I live in canada so that's over 30$ plus the shipping to canada and duties. Wonderful.
62,387,can it be turne,Yes
62,388,"For me,the Avent Basic Baby Monitor it's the best one, but recently something strange has happened ... I turn on the unit and after a few seconds goes on mute and I can no longer hear the sounds of my baby's room. When i push the sensitivity button its go back to hearing . It does not last many more seconds and it happens again. I have a stand by one (brand new) and the same happened. Can you help  me to understand what could be?","I am having the same problem. After pushing the sensitivity button, I can hear out of the baby's room, then the unit mutes after a few seconds. Not quite sure if this is a battery saving feature...I always have mine plugged in next to my bed! It does go on when there is noise in the baby's room. I thought perhaps there was a reset button on the parent unit. Perhaps changing the battery will help. I guess it's time to refer to the owners manual. :-)"
62,389,Is there a back up battery in the base unit for power outages? Are units sold in the USA that are dual voltage?,There is a place on both the parent end and the baby end where you can put batteries. The unit also beeps if it loses power. I'm also not sure about the dual voltage. This is a great monitor though. My son is now almost 2 1/2 and mine still works wonderfully.
62,390,Does the baby unit take batteries?,The unit that stays with baby does not take batteries. It can only work by being plugged into an outlet. The other unit that goes with the parent can take batteries.
63,391,Does the elastic go all the way around the sheet or just on the corners?,The elastic on the fitted sheet goes all the way around the mattress.
63,392,Is it too much of a pain to replace the elastic yourself? Just sew a better quality one on?,"Well considering I struggle to sew on a button, I personally would rather just buy these! These do wash up well, and considering how challenging some sheets are to fit a mattress, these fit quite well and go on/off easily."
63,393,Can someone give the measurements for this sheet? The description should have given them!!!,\'Standard measurements are 51 5/8 inches long and 27 1/4 inches\' (from ehow.com).  Just looked this up because I wasn't sure of the \'standard\' crib measurements.  Glad I did because I thought ours was \'standard\' but it is slightly bigger so these would not have worked.  I agree they should have the dimensions in the description.
64,394,Will this fit a Graco infant car seat and base?,It should.. I used it with a toddler car seat and there was a lot of room left.
64,395,Does a Graco Nautilus fit in this bag? Does the Graco Nautilus 3-in1 car seat fit into this Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag?,Yes it does. I have used it multiple times with my son's Nautilus 3-in-1 car seat and it fit perfectly.
64,396,Does the Evenflo Tribute Car Seat fit int his bag?,You'll have to check description for dims. I have a Safety First - 35 and there is plenty of room.
64,397,will this work with a Britax front,It should fit fine.  I have a Britax that is larger than the Frontier and there is extra room for jackets in the bag.
64,398,Will this fit a Britax Pavilion convertible seat?,"It fits a britax Boulevard, so if your car seat is similar in size, yes, it will fit."
64,399,Did you use this bag to check your car seat at the ticket counter or at the gate?  Did you have any damage to your seat?,I checked the bag in at baggage claim.  There was no damage to my car seat.
64,400,does it fit chicco n,"Yes, the Chicco Nextfit would fit just fine"
64,401,Does this fit the Britax Advocate G4 convertible car seat? Thanks.,"Hi, We have this one: Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx (Prior Model)The size of the bag was plenty big for our car seat. I believe it would be just fine for the Britax car seat that you have too. We had an issue with the quality of this bag. It is cheaply made and broke upon our first use. I wouldn't say that the car seat is particularly over heavy but a travel car seat bag should handle ... a car seat! The handle broke from the bag when we tried carrying it from the car to the check in counter. The bag material busted open but not from the lack of room, but the type of material. It's just not usable. I would not buy this bag again. I hope this helps."
65,402,"Is it necessary to buy this if we have the waterproof mattress? First time parent, not sure what to expect :)","I would definitely recommend the mattress cover even though the mattress is waterproof.  In fact, I would get 2 of them; one to wash and one to use.  You don't want the mattress smelling like pee for one, and it definitely will if you don't.  It will also just be a lot cleaner.  I'm all about making less of a mess if I can to have less to clean since there is already so much other cleaning that cannot be avoided.  And pee is the cleanest thing that can end up on the mattress!  I like to use peroxide in  a spray bottle with paper towels when I do clean a waterproof mattress.  I like that it doesn't smell and does a good job cleaning.  I think it's a safer cleaner compared to say a Clorox wipe. I would recommend the flat one, instead of the fitted, so it will be easier to change.  Or if your mattress isn't too heavy, it's really no big deal just to take the entire mattress out to change it so in that case the fitted would be fine too.  (But then you have to take the crib bumper off.  I actually took mine off since I got tired of taking it off and on all of the time.)Hopefully you have a Naturepedic mattress or other brand that doesn't use fire retardant chemicals to pass the flammability test. I've even read on a natural health doctor's website that when the pee, or other bodily fluids, mix with the fire retardant chemicals, it has a chemical reaction that makes an odorless gas that can cause SIDS."
65,403,Does this contain any flame retardants?,"No, Naturepedic items do not contain chemical flame retardants. This item is non-toxic."
65,404,Does this add any softness to the mattress? We have the naturepedic lightweight dual stage and is very firm!!,If your looking to add more softness/cushion to the mattress for a toddler or older child you could add the Naturepedic quilted pad. However it is not a waterproof pad.Naturepedic PC93 Non Waterproof Organic Cotton Deluxe Crib Mattress Pad
65,405,Does this pad add any bulk to the sides of the mattress when it is on with a sheet?,No extra bulk on the sides than a fitted sheet.  The top is a little thicker but doesn't prevent normal crib sheets from fitting.
65,406,will this contain the flame retardants in a conventional mat,Hi. I'm writing from Naturepedic again. I responded to this earlier but just realized that I probably initially misunderstood your question. You said 'will this contain' not 'does this contain' so I believe you meant to ask if this product would prevent the flame retardants in a conventional mattress from off-gassing. Correct? The answer is no. To contain the off-gassing you need a complete seal - no possibility of air leaking out anywhere.
65,407,What were the dimensions of the crib sheets you bought? Do the crib sheets fit your mattress well? Can you recommend some sheets to go w/ this pad?,"I got the Naturepedic crib sheets also.  The mattress pad may be a bit looser than the sheets, but they are all well-fitted."
65,408,does anyone know what the waterproof layer IS made of? so in the description it says the \'ultra thin waterproof layer\' is no vinyl/pvc; no phthalates; no latex...does anyone know what it IS?  is it the food grade poly they use on the crib mattresses?,"It's made of food grade polyurethane (according to their website). No waterproofing is organic, but you have to decide if the trade off is worth it for you. Honestly, I'm still back and forth on this myself! From my research, this does seem to be the best (or one of the best) organic waterproof mattress pads out there."
66,409,"Do they come with slow, medium or fast flow nipples?",Slow nipples.
66,410,Do these bottles leak while feeding baby or is there a strong seal around neck of bottle and ring?,"Generally they do not leak, but a couple of times I haven't gotten the nipple in straight and then it does leak."
66,411,Does anyone know how to warm up this bottle straightly from refrigerator without breaking it or destorying breast milk's nutrient?,"Hello you can do it two ways, the first is easy just put the milk in a pan heat it slowly till lukewarm and pour it back in the bottle (rub the bottle in you hands while the milk is warming to get it to room temp and it will not break when you return the milk to it) I do not know how that would affect the nutrients however. The second way is fine for nutrients but more time consuming: take a pot and fill it with cool tap water and put it on the stove on low heat with the bottle in it hold the bottle on its side so it floats and does not touch the bottom of the pan spin the bottle with your hand as it heats so all the milk heats evenly.Try to keep it off the bottom of the pan the entire time you heat.  I use this second method with frozen bottle of breast milk and have never broken a bottle. Good luck! Blessings to you and you little one."
66,412,have you tried putting this bottle in a fr,Since the bottles leaked too much I just stopped using them.
66,413,Do these bottles have measurement markings so you can tell how many ounces are in the bottle?,Yes they do. In ounces and mL.
66,414,how do you sterilize them?,I used dr. Brown bottle sterilizer.
66,415,Do you boil the ring and cap to sanitize as well? Concerns about boiling plastic?,"Yes! You can boil these. If you are concerned about them melting, you may want to bring your water to a good rolling boil then throw them into to the pot and put a top on it. Turn off the heat and let it sit there for about 10 minutes. Then take them out with a pair of tongs and let air dry on a clean towel. I hope this helps! :)"
67,416,"What is the maximum weight these toys handle? I know they are for kids, but I also know adults are tempted to try them out...",larger kids kinda stretch them out so I don't think adults would continually be able to utilize the toy but my daughters in the 43ish lb range have no trouble bouncing them around the house.
67,417,Does this product come with the pump?,Yes it does. One of those hand pumps.
67,418,Is a one year old too young for this? he's a little guy!,"Yes, I bought this for my granson who at the time was 13 months, he is a tall baby but not tall enough. He is now 18 months was able to start jumping on this about a month ago. It is top heavy so he tumbled over the head unless you held him on it. He is now able to jump around like no tomorrow. It is a wonderful toy but I would recommend for children over 16-18 months."
67,419,"Does this come packed in a box product box, or is the actual 'cow' directly put in the shipping box ?",Deflated cow comes packed in a nice box and that is then put into another box for shipping.
67,420,How long does it hold one \'inflation\'?,Filled it when bought and haven't had to since. Have only had it 3 wks .
67,421,A lot of negative fdbk about pump recommended on Amazon site.What is the best pump for this?,"Hi, pump it up best with your garage compressors like you do for footballs or basketballs.  windchimes"
67,422,"Is the black cow all black, or does it have white spots?",Black with white spots
67,423,How do you know how much air to pump into it?  Anyone have one pop on them?,"Not sure how much exactly. I just put enough in it to make it pretty firm. I imagine it will pop, but you would probably know it was coming. You want it tight, but not to the point it starts stretching out."
67,424,what do you use to inflate it? Does any of the hand pumps sold on Amazon work to inflate it?,It comes with a pump in the box
68,425,"How do I wash this pillow?   It has a very musty, almost barn-like smell to it and it permeates through the pillowcase.",use some laveder trimings put them in a pillow case with the pillow. I am sure it will absorbe and alter the scent of the pillow
68,426,What is the actual size of this pillow? Many reviews state that it is very small and one reviewer listed the size as bigger than the product info.,"I no longer have this pillow but it was a good size for crib, and that means small. Certainly closer to travel pillow than any standard size."
68,427,do you think it is good for 4.5 year old or a stander size will be better? He started to use a twin bed today?,"I unintentionally answered yes before but this pillow is much too small for a 4 year old. My 2 year old only used it for 6-months before moving to a standard size pillow. Not being washable, if you have small kids who have occasional accidents in bed, it wasn't the best solution for us."
68,428,Is this pillow more on the flatter side or fluffier side?,It's more on the flatter side.
68,429,"Does this pillow have a removable, washable cover?  If not, how does one find a pillowcase that fits it?","It does not. I have washed it in the washing machine (not sure if that's wrong, but it came out fine.) I originally bought a small pillow case for it. The case was still a little too big."
69,430,How do you keep a toddler from opening seat belt latches? I have a grandson (2.5yrs) that opens seat belt and car seats at will. Very disconcerting when you are driving alone and he climbs up front with you! Any ideas beside stapling him to the seat?,"I just stumbled acrossed your post. My youngest of four is now 11 years old.  He could unbuckle anything and everything. I went so far as to call car seat manufacturers to see if they had any ideas.  I know, I know, I felt like a terrible mother who couldn't control my own 2 year old. Every single time he unbuckled, I would pull the car over and buckle him in again. Eventually, he got the message. We had to do a lot of practice runs to go places HE wanted to go to. I just kept telling him that I would not keep driving to our destination if he wasn't \'safe and buckled\' and that I would \'drive again, when he was buckled\'.    I never let it get to a point where he was out of the seat.  Fortunately, I was able to lock the windows, so he couldn't do that to me!  Trust me, if he could have, he would have.  I'm sure by now your problem has been resolved and he has moved on to a new phase!!  Perhaps this will help someone else!"
70,431,What are these covers made of?,Pul. Same as any other cover.
70,432,Is the cover true to size?,We've found the sizing to be true so far with small and medium
70,433,What is the difference between a thirsties duo wrap as opposed to diaper cover?,"I personally used both the duo wrap and diaper covers do not come with inserts, the cover has a smaller weight range than the duo wrap because the duo wrap has bottons (as well as the Velcro) to make it bigger as you need it"
70,434,anyone use over disposable diapers?,Are you just trying to make the disposable diapers \'cute\'???  Because that seems like a wast of money to me.  You can get outfits that come with covers.  I'm not sure why you would want to use it over a disposable.  It works great with prefolds and cloth inserts though!  I have two and they've been GREAT!
71,435,is there any blue the comforter? Or is it all shades of brown?,Just shades of tan to brown.
71,436,Is this for a mini crib?,what's the size of the sheet?
71,437,what country is this set made in?,Made in China
72,438,Can this be used on a bunk bed with a bunkyboard (no box spring)?,"I have a box spring with a mattress. This bed rails has a strap with a round metal plate, about 6\' in diameter, that is used as a stopper to prevent it from loosening away from the mattress/ box spring. I am not familiar with the bunkyboard."
72,439,Will this bed rail work on a toddler size bed with a crib mattress?,I'm not sure. I am using it on a full sized/full size mattress. The weight of the mattress helps keep it in place snuggly. Crib mattress might be a little too light.
72,440,I don't have a boxspring on the bed I'll be using this guard rail on...will that be an ,"It shouldn't be an issue. You would only have a problem if you have a mattress on the ground because the \'hook\' on the opposite side of the rail to secure the guard rail is vertical with a plastic piece going both up and down to prevent it from slipping. (Not sure why you'd need a guard rail in this case anyway, but just letting you know how the attachment works.) Hope that made sense. If the mattress is on a standard bed frame, this guard rail should work just the same as if there were a box spring too."
72,441,Anyone know if it would work with a king mattress? (I know it says up to queen...but here's hoping),"No it definitely cannot.  I have a King and purchased it thinking it still might work.  So I made it work. It has straps that go between the mattress that connect on the other side of the bed so thats why it wornt work, they are not long enuf to reach the other side so that you can clip the ends onto the mattress.  So I had something I could tie to extend the straps so that they could reach over.  After that it was fine,very sturdy, strong and safe you just have to figure something out if you have a King to make it work for you if you buy it.  Good luck"
72,442,can this product be used if 2 bed rails are needed for on,I have 2 of these. One on each side of the bed. Works great.
73,443,I bought this mattress but my 18lb baby sinks down on it. Is it just me or this is NOT a firm mattress?,"My daughter is a little heavier, but we've had the same problem.  It doesn't seem to be very firm.  Need to purchase a crib mattress for our son and will not be getting this one again."
73,444,Does this mattress seem to \'offgas\' or have a chemical smell?,I have two of them and neither one has a chemical smell.
73,445,package size,it's not much bigger then the mattress.
73,446,Is this mattress good for a 2-4 year old? Thinking ahead once we convert to a toddler bed.,I think this mattress would be great for a 2-4 year old. It is not too soft or too firm. Both of my kids have this mattress and they will still be on it when I convert their cribs to toddler beds.
73,447,Is it necessary to use a waterproof mattress cover with this mattress since the mattress itself is waterproof?,"No you don't. I've never even bought a mattress protector cause all my son's toddler mattresses are the waterproof material. Just wipe clean in case of a accident. Until they're in a regular twin mattress, you really don't need the protectors."
73,448,"I have received this mattress from Amazon.  With my Simmons Crib, I can fit my entire hand in the crack on the length & the width. Please advise.",You could get a bumper and then slide it down into the crack. If that doesn't work them return the mattress and measure the crib and get a different mattress.
74,449,Can the Chicco Liteway Surf accomodate a carseat,Hello. The chicco liteway cannot accomodate a carseat. The chicco liteway plus can. I don't know if there is a chicco liteway surf.
74,450,What are the wheels made of? Is the stroller good for tqll toddlers*  33\'+,"The wheels seem to be made of a thick, rubbery plastic. My toddler is 34\', 28lbs, and still has a lot of room to grow with it."
75,451,"Has anyone found silverware for toddlers that is not made in China preferably made in the USA? I have searched high and low for silverware for a toddler that is not made in China.  They all say responsibly made in China or something to that effect.  With all the news of products and food being contaminated in China or coming from China, I am on a quest to find toddler silverware made in the USA that is also BPA, PVC, Phthalate, lead and melamine free.  I do not want to buy products that hold food or go in your mouth from China. I called \'The Little Seed\' and the Thinkbaby BPA Free Feeding Set, Orange is made in Korea.  Don't we make anything here in the USA anymore?",Look on the internet (or locally if you live in a large city) for handmade wooden utensils.  I had a spoon made locally by an artist out of local recycled hardwood and I couldn't have been happier.
75,452,are these hot food,"Yes, they can hold hot food. They are not microwave safe though."
75,453,"Just to make sure, does it comes with spoon and","only containers, no fork no spoon"
75,454,On the back of the box it mentions coming with a fork and spoon - but they were not in there. Is it supposed to come with fork and spoon?,I did not get a fork and spoon
75,455,Is this contains spoon and pork?,This set does come with spoon and fork.
76,456,"The tray height from the floor seems a little low, has anyone noticed if this highchair sits the same or lower than other highchairs on the market?",Seems this high chair may be a good option if we would like a chair that works for both our regular table & kitchen island (which is a little taller)?  I am having a hard time finding a chair that would work for both heights.
76,457,The pad seems to be too thin with hard plastic all around.  Is it comfy enough for my 4-months old baby?,"I'm not too sure...my DD was very small when born and so I think she was about 6 (or so) months before she sat in the chair. If memory serves, we used a towel to give her more stability initially. The chair was one of her favorite places to be so I know she found it comfortable but I can't speak for all children."
76,458,The top white chair part swivels about 2 inches in each direction. The silver base pole is staying stationary. Is this normal?,over the years mine has developed a little bit of wiggle but I could not say if it was two inches or so but there definitely is some give to it. It still functions as intended.
76,459,Does the white have a cool greenish tinge to it? I've seen pics of the white with the white seat cover and they look like two dif. shades of white.,"Hello and thank you for your question!  Currently, the Flair seat base comes is available in two color options as seen on the detail page: white or gray.  Depending upon the color combination you choose, you will receive either a white base or a gray base.  The white base does not have a greenish tinge.  Thank you!"
76,460,What is the diameter of the base? I want to know if it has a smaller than other highchairs as we live in a small space.,"No idea about the actual diameter width (as we don't have this anymore), but I do remember it is pretty large, prob larger than the space a regular high chair takes up. But, it's an awesome high chair! I had 2, used with my twins and LOVED it."
76,461,The tray is much much smaller than other high chairs.  Is this an issue for anyone?  we want to use this for a toddler as well.,No. The tray is actually just the right size for a baby/toddler. They can reach everything that is on it. And it's not a pain to wash because it fits nicely in the sink.
77,462,how is it on carpet?,works great on carpet
77,463,Just wanting to make sure this is the GT model. Picture shows GT.,I am not sure it says wipable seat mine had a removable cloth seat and I threw it out since it was dangerous and they would not help me . best bet if you have store near you that sells it look at it if has plastic clips to hold seat then be careful you could call company and ask them what holds seat on .
77,464,Can I fold this walker? so I can store easier.,"No, it doesn't fold. But if you have the room, I highly recommend it; my nephew loved it, got a lot of use out of it, and a lot of compliments from everyone!"
77,465,Anyone know the difference between the regular car model that says combi on the seat and the GT model that says GT on the seat?  Gt is more expensive,GT350 Mustang replica.
78,466,How does the sizing work for this?  Does it depend on the size of the baby or the size of the wearer?,"I'm 5'2\' 115 lbs, and the small works perfect. A meduim would be way to long. It depends more on the size of the wearer. I've been able to adjust it to fit my baby from 4 months to 10 months so far. She will get too heavy long before she gets too big for the sling."
78,467,Does this sling have a zipper pouch?,"What is the name of product? As it doesn't tell me, so I don't want to answer without proper information."
78,468,What size is this sling? Extra Large?,The maya wrap is used by wrapping around your body. It look large but this particular one is listed as small.
78,469,size,Fits true to size. A small I think goes to 5'4\' and 140 lbs or so.
79,470,How does the sizing work for this?  Does it depend on the size of the baby or the size of the wearer?,"I'm 5'2\' 115 lbs, and the small works perfect. A meduim would be way to long.

79,473,size,Fits true to size. A small I think goes to 5'4\' and 140 lbs or so.
80,474,"Would you recommend getting a separate mattress pad cover, despite this mattress being waterproof? A standard size pad is 52x27--too small?","I decided to purchase the separate matress pad just as an extra protection measure.  To be perfectly honest, since the crib is used for my granddaughter and not used everyday, I probably did not need it.  I believe I did have a protective cover on the matresses for my own children."
80,475,It this mattress plastic covered,"it is covered in a plastic type covering. Note, it is an oversized crib mattress, not standard size. It works with my Dream on Me crib. Other mattresses were too small and there was at least 6 inches between the long side AND  \'headboard\' of the crib and the mattress"
80,476,"I believe standard size for a crib mattress is 52*28, would this 53*31 size fit in a baby bed? Than","Yes, it fits just fine in my son's toddler bed. He has the Dream On Me Classic Sleigh Toddler Bed.  It is the same size as a crib mattress. It does fit snuggly but it's not too snug."
80,477,Will this fit the following Toddler bed ?http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Toddler-Bed-Canopy/dp/B003IT79I6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1386612394&sr,We brought a similar mattress for our son's bed (a Disney Cars style bed) and it fits perfectly. We have a handmade crib that we've used for all our kids and both the previous mattress and the Dream on Me mattress fit both crib & character bed perfectly.
80,478,Does this fit Davinci brand cribs/toddler beds?,It did fit a toddler bed (Disney toddler bed by Delta).
80,479,Does anyone know what crib sheets will fit this mattress???,All crib sheets and toddler bed sheets
81,480,Will these interlock with the 24 x 24 tiles as well?,"Yes, all eWonderWorld mats interlock. Whether it is a 24\' x 24\' or a 12\' x 12\'."
81,481,Does it include a storage container/bag?,"no, i will just use the box it was shipped in."
81,482,Anyone know if the tiles get slippery when wet?,These tiles have a textured side and a smoother side.  The smooth side might get slippery if a LOT of water (or beverage) were spilled but I've not found them to ever be slippery with a little milk or juice spilled.  And because the tiles are foam and give a little when you walk on them they are less likely to present a hazard even with water on them.
81,483,Has the construction of this product changed?  I dont understand how some state there is absolutely no ordor but others comment on the strong odor.,I am unaware of a change.  Maybe they are talking of initial smell with you unwrap it?  I have had mine for some time now and don't smell anything and my son loves these mats.  We build forts with them sometimes or use them on the hard floor as a cushioned place to play.  Have had zero issues with smell or anything in regards to these.
81,484,In what country are the foam pieces made in?,These mats are made in Taiwan.
81,485,"I just received these and I am very happy!  This is probably a dumb question, but do I place the textured side or smooth side up?",Textured side up :-)
81,486,Can this be put on top of cArpet or only hard wood floors?,"Yes, our wonder mats can work on both hard wood floors and carpet."
82,487,Does this work on cribs with a curved rail?,My crib's side rails are curved and this crib guard fits over them just fine.
82,488,is the \'padding\' thick enough to cushion a head bump.  The edge of our crib has a lip and when our baby stands up he bangs his head.  How ,Maybe 1/2 an inch. My toddler sometimes bangs her head on the front rail when she is mad. She doesn't seem phased by that fact. I would think it would seem less cushiony than a bumper the doctors tell parents not to put in the cribs. Hope this helps.
82,489,"Okay so the big question!!! Has your baby learned to untie these? If so, don't these pose a similar risk as bumpers if they came off and fell in crib?",I double knotted mine to start with & she just noticed the ties recently but can't undo them (yet anyway).  I guess they could pose the same type of problem if you're worried about bumpers.  The underside of the CribWrap is plastic (so not a breathable material).  My daughter has slept on her stomach from the time she learned to roll over and she flops around so much that I was glad I had also put bumpers in her bed (which I had to weave through the slats since she could pull the bumper down).  I have bumpers and CribWraps on the front & both sides of her crib and have never had a problem.
82,490,For those of you who have the white color.....does it seem to get stained easily?  Debating on getting white or gray.  Crib I have is ,"No, I have only had to wash it once and it washed up nicely. I put it in on warm and air dried it. I also used a small amount of vinagar and no fabric softener so it would not pill. The good news is that in general babies are still pretty clean in the crib and my baby bites it all of the time."
82,491,Does anyone still have the tags on it? I took mine off but now I am curious if the tags say anything about meeting Technical Bulletin 117?,I am wondering the same thing about the flammability. Did you ever find out the answer?
82,492,Is the white rail cover really white or more of an ivory?,It's more of an ivory color. But still looks nice. My daughter's crib is white.
82,493,"Read reviews about fluff coming out from underside-have you had this issue?  If yes, how long have you had the cover and times it was washed?",I have had the cover for several months but have not washed it so I cant say if the fluff comes out. I will say that this is the softest rail cover I found and it stays in place.
82,494,The circumference of the rail I would like to protect is 20\'.  Is the 18\' length plus the length of the attaching strings enough to cover 20\'?,"Definitely. Mine is about 19\' and I have 3\' of string length after a double knot. Plus, I've washed it twice too."
83,495,Does this kit come in an unopened package?,"Yes, the package was unopened."
84,496,Can the pacifier be removed for separate washing and sanitizing?,No it can't. I wash the whole thing in the laundry washer then hand wash the paci
84,497,Baby wakes every time he drops paci. He is still too small to grab it and put it in his mouth. Will this help keep it near his mouth? He's 10 wo.,"The monkey does weight the pacifier down a little. It won't keep the pacifier in his mouth if he's prone to pushing it out with his tongue, though. I've found that I can sort of prop the monkey up with a blanket or fold it under itself and that keeps it in his mouth."
84,498,Is this pacifier breastfeeding friendly? We currently use MAM with no problems.,"I'm sorry hun..I really don't know, since it's the pacifier they give babies at the hospital. .and my babies take it with no problems. But I know a few other moms that exclusively BF and used this with no problems.  I guess it all depends on ur baby. But if ur baby takes Mam with no problems. .I'd just stick with that."
84,499,I'm guessing you aren't able to throw this in the wash since it has a pacifier attached. how do you wash it?,"I have tossed mine in the washing machine a couple of times after an \'incident\' . The binky won't absorb any of the laundry soap, but if you were worried, you could use dish soap afterwards to remove any residue."
84,500,Is there any safety concern with the bags of beads in the hands and feet?,"The only issue I found is that once your baby has teeth and they chew on the hands and feet, they may be able to make holes and get the beads out. I have several of the same one so I just took the one with a hole and sewed it"
84,501,ARE THEY MADE IN AMERICA?,"According to the tag, they are made in China"
84,502,Some of the animal Wubbanub pacifier descriptions say BPA free but I didn't see that on the monkey description.  Are all the pacifiers used BPA free?,"the pacifiers are phillips avent soothie pacifiers which are BPA free. Philips AventBPA Free Soothie Pacifier, 3+ months, Green, 2 Count"
84,503,Are there any dentist reviews on the wubbanub with toy being heavier than just a pacifier in the mouth and its impact on developing teeth?,I'm a dentist and would not recommend it.  I routinely see kids with an open bite (front teeth do not come together) due to a pacifier or even thumb or finger habit.  Not all kids develop this--but many do.  Adding a weight (any weight) to the end of the pacifier will require the child to hold onto it tighter with their jaws and teeth--and if your kid is one of the \'lucky\' ones who develops an open bite it will be worse than if you had been using a pacifier alone--and you'll be more likely to be \'lucky\' enough to pay for braces when they are older.  I am not opposed to pacifiers for infants--just the ones with weights on them.  And as an FYI stopping their use (or a thumb or finger habit) by age 2 or at the latest 4 gives you the best chance of not affecting their jaw and teeth development.
85,504,Does the Tiny Love Musical Nature Stroll Toy Bar attach to the Tiny Love Take Along Baby Bouncer?,we got this toy and attached it to the bugaboo bee stroller and a maclaren. though it worked better with the bugaboo... we actually got to attach it to several high chairs in restaurants... not all but most! pretty useful toy that my son loved for About a year....
85,505,Is this BPA free?,Sorry I do not have the packaging any longer.
85,506,"Do the clips on this toy bar rotate?  Would I be able to clip it on two surfaces that aren't exactly parallel, or across a 90 degree corner?",yes they rotate and can adjust to grip multiple width items.  The bend close to the grips can help get it at the right angle across your 90 degree corner
85,507,"how do you switch melodies?  (i see this is a previous question, but i didnt see an answer as to how to do it)","It's actually funny...I don't really know. I never did figure it out. When my son turned 4 months am started banging the toy he changed the tune. I tried banging it myself, nothing but the same music came on. I hand the toy back and he bangs it and the music changed. I'd ask him but he doesn't talk yet...Sorry I'm no help. My sons keeping it a secret. He's 1 now, hopefully someone else can help."
85,508,Will it fit a Britax carseat?,It will definitely not stay on a britax car seat. I would not recommend this product.
85,509,Does this fit on the Chicco NextFit convertible carseat OR Graco FastAction Fold Stroller?,"I don't have experience with either of these products; however, the way it's made it seems like you could easily bend it to adjust to any size width car seat or stroller."
85,510,Does anyone know if this bar will fit onto a Chicco Infant Carrier? I am looking for a toy bar that has music but I want to make sure it will fit.,"The song is very short for start and I still don't know how to play the other tune by hand. It turns on when it is dropped by accident. What I do know is that the part that attaches is sort of like a clip. The opening is about 1 1/2 inch wide and you twist the circle orange attached on the top of the clip to tighten it. I did use it on a infant carrier my mother in law bought me, but don't recall the brand. The whole musical toy is adjustable and can be clipped onto any surface that can be clipped if its not bigger than 1 1/2 inch wide. I hung it upside down, upright, and different ways. Overall, I like it because I can hang other toys onto it. Still have it and I still don't know how to get the other song to turn on. I drop it and oh yah, the other song turns on. I hit it, nothing. Oh well. Hope this helps."
85,511,Can this fit onto baby jogger city select pram?,"I don't own one of those strollers so I can't really confirm. I did look it up online and it doesn't seem to have a bumper bar which is where I used to hang it for my baby. You might be able to attached to the main frame but it all depends on how wide the stroller is. It looks pretty wide in the pics so the toy might be stretched and a lay a little flatter and closer to baby which might be annoying. If it fits, this toy is a lot if fun and easy to attach and detach. Only detach one side to get baby out. Good luck."
85,512,how much battires and which ones?,3 of the small 1.5V batteries. Comes already with them
85,513,Can't get the music to play.  Got a replacement and the 2nd doesn't work either.  Is there something else I need to do besides just press the box?,"No.  The same thing happened to me with the original and the replacement Amazon sent.  I contacted Tiny Love and they eventually sent me a new music box which looks different from the one the toy came with and it works, but barely."
86,514,what dimension are cubes in inches?,About 1 inch squares and a little bit deeper.
86,515,Does this product come with a lid? Thanks.,No - I just wrap it in Seran wrap or foil when I put it in the freezer.
86,516,Is this BPA free?,"I know they're PVC, phthalate and nitrosamine free"
86,517,Can this be used to freeze breast milk?,"Yes. I've used it to freeze breast milk (short term) as well as fruit, veggie, and meat pur\u00e9es (long term). They are exactly 1 oz cubes so you know what baby is getting. Only downside is that the cubes don't fit into most bottle openings if you plan to defrost them in the bottle. In that case, I'd put what I needed in mason jars and defrost it that way and then put it in baby's bottle."
86,518,Where is this product made?,"I've seen some of their other products are made in Taiwan, so I assume that's where these are made as well."
86,519,Is there a lid with this?,There is no lid.
87,520,Has anyone used these in non-pocket diapers?  I use a pre fold diaper with a thirsties snap cover and am wondering if the inserts would work for that,"I think they would work great! I am new to cloth diapering and really like these inserts so far. I lay them in all kinds of diapers to add absorption with little bulk, including covers and All In Ones. I usually put them behind another faster absorbing insert to use with my two year old. I have not tried them by themselves with a cover. They would work great combined with a prefold too. I would put them closest to the diaper cover since they absorb more slowly than prefolds."
87,521,Is this a hemp/cotton blend? Wondering the percentages too.,Yes the percentage is 55% hemp 45% cotton
87,522,Can the large size be used alone in a pocket diaper? Is the absorbency quick enough?,My child urinates in large volumes and one insert didn't work. I have to use two.  The outer cotton layer does absorb quickly which is helpful.
87,523,Is there another heavy wetter solution? Bought these and had two in a pocket diaper; she wet them BOTH within an hour...,"We ended up buying Kauai Baby Goodnight Heavy Wetter diapers. They come with two super thick microfiber inserts. We use both inserts plus a Thirsties hemp insert at night. But, this would be super bulky for daytime."
87,524,Does it have the snaps on the insert like the ones that come with the diaper?,"No, there are no snaps."
87,525,Is size small worth investing in? Or is the large too bulky for 0-6 month old?,"Not sure how big your LO is, but mine is 14 pounds and these still work great. They're definitely not as large as a typical insert, but still absorb really well. If your LO is on the larger size, if probably buy the larger size."
87,526,Mine just came in the mail. Are there any special instructions to prep them before I use them? Or can I just wash them once and then put them to use?,Wash once or twice then use. The more you wash them over time the more absorbant they become.
87,527,Can this insert sit directly against baby's skin?  Or does it have to be used inside a pocket like microfiber?,It is a natural fiber and can be against the skin inside a cover or can be used in a pocket too
88,528,are the Sassy  teethers BPA,"Sadly, I have no idea...but their customer service is AWESOME, i had to call them for something else once. The phone number on their website takes you directly to a real person, they're like a little mom 'n pop shop."
88,529,Is this a two pack or does only one come for 2.99?,When I bought these they came in a two pack. Either purple and pink or dark blue and light blue. I'm not sure if that is still the case but I would imagine that it is.
88,530,how to clean,Warm water and dish soap. Just rinse it really well.
89,531,Are these sheets true white or a natural ivory color?,they are white
89,532,What is fabric content/thread count difference between Quickzip organic crib sheets and Quickzip crib sheets? Any difference in washing/wear results?,I do not own the normal crib sheets but have the quickzip sheets -- we are going on year two and they have held up perfectly. the 15 seconds it takes to change the sheets make an enormous difference. Soft like normal sheets and apparently indestructable.
90,533,Why should this product only be used with cotton bedding?  Will it be a problem if my mattress is not cotton?,"After wrapping the mattress in the Serendipity protector, additional layers of bedding should be all cotton.  Mattress material does not matter - you're wrapping it to prevent off-gassing of the fire retardants and other chemicals inside the mattress which would be breathed in by your baby. These still escape, but harmlessly through the bottom of the wrap's vents underneath the mattress.  On top of the wrap is to be only cotton fabric. We used a 30 x 54 (approx) washed 100% cotton white bath towel as a mattress 'pad' - just for a bit of absorbency. Babies must not have fluffy padding in their beds! On top of the towel was placed a cotton fitted sheet. That's all you need - mattress wrap (which is already waterproof), towels and sheets. Practical, easy to change, and healthy for baby. Use unscented detergent and no fabric softener. Simple and safe."
90,534,Does this fit a co-sleeper mini bassinet mattress?,It's made to fit a full crib mattress although we cut one and used clear packing tape to put on our co sleeper mini.
90,535,So I am not supposed to use a waterproff mattress protector over this? Is it just the sheet on top?,"You should not use a waterproof protector on top of Serendipity. Serendipity is waterproof but also protects your baby\'s sleep environment from chemicals, organisms and especially gasses that come from all crib mattresses. Exposure to chemical emissions from crib mattresses have been linked to the epidemic rise in allergies and asthma in babies and gas emissions have been linked to SIDS/SUID. In fact not a single SIDS/SUID tragedy has been reported for any baby that has been protected by a Serendipity Toxin Shield.The Serendipity Toxin Shied is permanently installed over your crib mattress. You can then put your cotton fitted crib sheet on top of it. Some parents use a cotton bath towel on top of Serendipity and under the sheet to soften the sleep surface."
90,536,Can you re-use the wrap? I might be getting a new mattress and want to know if the adhesive will allow me to un-stick it and re-stick it,"Yes, you can reuse it. You can also just retape it if you want. We bought an Ikea mattress, junior size, and used this cover for that instead of buying a twin sized cover."
90,537,is it water,Yes! Of course...it's plastic
90,538,does this cover use low density food grade polyethylene? if not what is it made out of?,Serendipity is made from Liniar Low Density PolyEthylene (LLDPE). Our proprietary formulation is FDA approved for direct food contact. More importantly our material is completely free from any additives. We call it Barefoot PE because it is polyethylene in its more pure and inert form.
91,539,"Is the tinting an even, solid tinting or is it the little dots all over it?  I am trying to find the even, solid ones.",The tint is a solid sheet of static cling plastic material.
91,540,What is this product made of? Is it PVC?,This product is made of PVC and is tested annually to meet all regulations and standards.
91,541,how do you get it off? I am renting a car and need to make sure i can get it off after our trip,They will peel right off just like a removable sticker. I also used in rental car. You'll love them.
91,542,Can these be cut to fit a side window?,Yes they can be cut to fit any window size
91,543,Do these offer UV protection?,I think it said that it has UVA/UVB protection on the box they came in.
91,544,how long are they. how  easy is it to put on and why can't you roll the window down with the cling shade on?,"The ones I bought are about 12 x 14\' or so, relatively easy to apply (but do bunch up and stick to themselves like tape when warm) - they will get peeled off/bunched up if you roll the window down with the shade on."
91,545,Is visibility good enough with these to use them on the driver's window? My new vehicle's windows are not tinted and the sun is very intense in the front seats.,"Yes. This order came with two, so I use one in the back window to shade the the baby's car seat, and one on the driver's side since my visor isn't wide enough to shade the sun on the driver's window. As a matter of fact, I double it over to make the filtering even stronger, and I can still see without a problem."
91,546,Can these be cut to fit the rear windows on a 2007 Civic Coupe?,Not worth buying
91,547,"Will this product work on tinted widows (will it mess up the tinting)? My windows were tinted after-market, but professionally inst","It won't mess the tinting. I have tinted windows and it does work. The only problem is that is makes the window a little blurry. Not easy to see through because it is like a adhesive paper, but you can reposition it several times if needed."
91,548,Can you put back car windows up and down with this on them?,I have no problem putting my car window up and down with this on.
92,549,"Is Ergobaby and ERGObaby the same company, and what's the difference between teething pads and sucking pads?","Before I had these pads my son would suck, chew then spit up on the Ergo strap so I think it's one in the same. I thought it be nicer if I didn't have to clean the Ergo carrier as often. As for the way Ergobaby is typed I'm not sure. I'd assume they are the same, because I don't think you can make a knock off using the same letters."
92,550,Can these be used as car seat strap covers too?,Sure. They arr the same size as the pads that come with my carseat.
92,551,Has anybody actually used these with there carseats?  Do they fit or are they too small?,They are not too small. They may actually be too big and slide down on car seat straps. I used those on the ergo baby carrier and they worked great. Love them.
93,552,What are the nipple size for these bottles?,They come with a nipple for newborn
93,553,Which number the nipple is?1 or 2? Thanks!,Size 1
93,554,nipple size,Medium flow.
93,555,What color did yhou recieve?,i received blue color
93,556,what size nipple comes with this bottle? size 1 or 2?,"Size 1 came with my order, you would have to order size 2 nipples separately."
94,557,How many diapers does this hold? And what receptacle and size receptacle is good/recommended?,Well I have 26 diapers and when almost all of them are dirty it's a little more than half full. so it holds a lot! I got a plain white 13 gallon trash  can with a step lever for the lid and it works great. I think I got it from target. Hope this helps!
94,558,Can anyone post the link to the trash can or diaper pail they used with this liner?  Thanks!,I use it with the Ubbi for cloth diapers. Fits fine and does a great job minimizing the smell.
94,559,Which side goes out?  Should the waxy side go inside (next to the diapers) or toward the outside?,I put the waxy side in towards the diapers.
94,560,I see that a lot of the negative reviews mention they should be washed in cold water -do they hold up in hot water?,"we've been using ours for 2 months now and we tend to forget to remove it after the cold rinse with the diapers, so it ends up staying for the hot wash as well. oops! But so far, so good. It's holding up great and we do laundry every other day (have just one diaper liner)."
94,561,"I'm going to use a trash can as my diaper pail, what size pail would this fit best?",I currently use a simplehuman 30L step can and it works great - it has a piece that holds the bag in place even when you open the trashcan to insert a diaper! any round kitchen trash can would probably work well.
94,562,How does this close? I don't see a string. Thanks,"This doesn't have a string. It's a pail liner, no string."
94,563,Do you know if this pail bag would work with the Busch Systems Odorless Cloth Diaper Pail? I'm considering getting the 7-gallon pail,We use this in a classic 9 gallon stainless steel step garbage can. I'm not sure of the pail you are referring to but the liner works perfect in our 9 gallon garbage can so I assume it would work just as well in a 7 gallon.
94,564,If I get a dark color like the chocolate brown will the color bleed on to the cloth diapers in the wash?,"I got the two of the chocolate brown color so I had a spare while I was washing a load of cloths. I wash & dry it with my cloth diapers and have never had any issues with the color bleeding. It is the same Gortex type liner as the diapers and I haven't experienced any other problems like it compromising the absorbancy, etc of my cloth diapers.  It says you can dry it in the dryer but personally I found it works better when you hang dry."
94,565,What kind of fabric is this made out of?,"PUL is a polyester/polyurethane laminated knit fabric with a laminate thickness of 1.00 mil. This fabric is waterproof, durable and has a slight crossgrain stretch."
95,566,"sorry, can someone clarify, does this come with slow flow n",this does not come with any nipples.  Just collars and caps and bottle tops.
95,567,Does the lid fit Enfamil Standard Flow Soft Nipple? I need something to cover the nipple when I take bottles to daycare.,I'm not sure about the enfamil ones but we used the dr browns nipples and they fit. I would personally recommend the medela nipples with this however because of the ease of use you get from matching products.
95,568,Is this kit compatible with the medela collection and storage bottle set?,Yes it does. I had the Medela Breast pump set and needed extra bottle covers and lids.
95,569,"Hi I have Medela bottle that come with Medela pump-in-style advanced breast pump. Will these parts rings, cover fit them?","They fit on my Ameda, Medela, evenflo and dr browns bottles. Most of these bottles and parts are somewhat interchangeable, especially the ones meant for pumps."
95,570,what comes in this spare parts bag. 2 of everything in the picture.,"extra covers, for nipples and covers for the bottles."
95,571,"I just want to be sure, are the nipples included slow flow or medium flow?","When I bought the set it did not come with nipples, but it will fit any medeka wide base nipple."
96,572,Can you place it a little to the side so that you are not so offset while running?,"Yes you can place it to the side. However, the device is not great for running. We attempted to use it once and never tried again."
96,573,Would this work as a lawn mower handle extension with 1\' tubed handle?  Can the handle be installed so it tilts further upward than the pic shows?,"The handle swings all the way up or down--it's not fixed in position. But not sure how it would work on a lawn mower, since every mower I've seen requires you to constantly be gripping the actual handle and/or attached lever, in order for the engine to run. So unless you're handy enough to rejigger that safety feature to work with this extension, it wouldn't work on a mower."
96,574,"I am 6'2\' and short in the arms, I want to use this on my jogger stroller.  Does it really adds that much height to the handle?","It adds length so it helps stride. My husband is 6'6\'. We use the Chico stroller, it adjusts higher. But when we want to use something less bulky we use the city jogger stroller with the easy stroll handle and it's pretty comfortable for husband. I'm 5'8\' and it works great for me as well. You will find that you walk sort of to the side of stroller. The handle is for one hand and is installed in center of handle bar which is a plus for longer legs"
96,575,Can you jog with this on??,Yes. Its great. I bought it cos I'm tall and needed extra height for my stroller - which it's great for. Also great for one handed strolling. Can jog with it as long as you have a jogging stroller.
96,576,a citi mini. because i'm adding to my carriage a buggy board for a toddler to stand and i bump into the board. will this,"I ordered these for the same reason - for a Britax stroller.  My husband is 6'8.  Unfortunately, we could not use them.  The extension is only big enough for one hand, so you have to push the stroller with only one hand all of the time.  That didn't work for us, so I returned the item."
96,577,can I use this as a carriage handle bar ext,"not sure,please be more specific -what kind of carriage? this one?http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Buberel_Coronation_coach_Catherine_the_Great.jpgthe handle rotates loosly and cannot be fixed in a particular position ...misha"
96,578,a citi mini. because i'm adding to my carriage a buggy board for a toddler to stand and i bump into the board. will this,"Realistically, it barely extends the length of the handlebar. It's more for needing to push a stroller with one hand and less for making it taller."
97,579,Did anyone else have problems re-snapping the cover after installing this seat rear-facing?  The rebound bar prevents you from accessing the snaps...,"Yes, I found that I had to pull on the whole cover to give it plenty of room for the snaps to get down where they go.  Once the snaps are down I would use one finger to snap them in place while holding the fabric with the other hand.  It wasn't too much after I had done it a few times."
97,580,"Anyone know where to find a replacement cup holder for these seats?  I've looked on Amazon and Ebay, no luck.","Call the manufacturer directly -- they stock replacement parts like replacement straps, covers, etc so I would think they would also have the cup holder."
97,581,"Can this seat be used for an infant, Im due to give birth and im wondering if I can bring her home from the hospital in this carseat or will it be too big and I will have to start out with an infan carrier?","My baby was born at 10lb 8oz, quite a bit bigger than a typical newborn, and was a homebirth - we didn't take him anywhere for 2 weeks.  When I put him in his seat for the first time, I was *really* uncomfortable with how far apart the shoulder straps are.  They slip off his shoulders unless I have the chest clip higher than typically suggested - basically as far up as I can go.  This is despite the infant insert padding.  I've never been a fan of needing a separate car seat for a newborn, but honestly I'm not sure this seat is the best choice because of the width between the shoulder straps."
97,582,Will it fit properly it an A4?,"We drive an SUV so I can't vouch for a smaller car, but I measured from the back of the seat the car seat sits on to where the car seat contacts the back of the passenger seat and it is 29 inches of space at it's longest point. Keep in mind the car seat is is wedged tightly against both seats, so if you can squeeze 29\' in your back seat and still sit in the passenger side, then yes it should work. You would also have more room in the middle seat if that is an option. This is probably the smallest (since the head rest for forward facing is removable) rear facing booster seat I have seen. My 3 year olds forward facing seat can sit rear, but would never fit in our SUV. This brand is a very cool model and we have been able to keep our 15 month old rear facing, and I think keeping him rear facing will be possible until he is two because of this seat."
97,583,"Anyone who has purchased the two tone gray and black seat please tell me if it is as light gray as the product picture? The customer picture is significantly darker, not sure which is more accurate",The one I purchased has a very light gray seat area.  The ones I see pictured now are a little different and seem to have spots or stripes.
97,584,Was this item recalled recently ?,"According to thefirstyears.com, no. The have recalls on a few items, but not car seats. See http://recalls.rc2corp.com/ and http://recalls.rc2corp.com/recalls_Past.html"
97,585,"Descriptions states this is \'Forward facing\'.  Is it also for rear facing?  Maybe I missed this somewhere, but I want to confirm.  :)","Yes, forward and rear."
97,586,is this a good carseat for flying,"This seat is definitely heavy and the rebound bar feature flips up & down when it's not installed and would flap around if not secured in a car so even having never flown with it, I'd say just from owning it, it's probably not the best seat for flying/transporting through an airport. I'm sure there are some that are lighter/more compact. Like the other person answered though, it is pretty easy to install so that would be a plus."
97,587,"Will this seat install in my 1997 Astro Van?  It is not set up for the latch system, I will on only have the shoulder/lap belt to use.?","yes it will. we don't use the seat belt but from reading the instructions, install seems pretty easy"
97,588,I am having a difficult time tightening the harness each time since that rebound bar is in the way.  Does anyone else have this problem?,"I don't generally loosen the straps each time I take him out. It was harder when he was a newborn because I didn't want to hurt him wrestling his limbs out of the harness! But now he is a few months old and actually moves his arm to help me get him out. If I have to tighten the harness while he is in it, I try and figure out how much I need to tighten it before I buckle it since it is really difficult to pull the strap to tighten it while it is buckled."
98,589,what size sheets will fit the 3\' and the 5\' dream on me mattress,Babies R Us Portable Crib Sheets fit perfect on 3\' Dream On Me Portable Mattress.
98,590,Will this fit the arms reach co sleeper?,"Did you ever find your answer? I was wondering the same thing. This mattress appears to be an inch wider than the mattress that comes with the arms reach co-sleeper, so I'm not sure if it will work or not, but I'd certainly like to know."
98,591,Can we fold this mattress up and take it in a suitcase in the airplane? Is it really that portable?,"Yes you definitly can fold it in half along the width, enough to put clothes in between and use it as packing foam."
98,592,Is this a FOAM mattress?,"Maybe covered, bought sheets for, is a medium soft, and still firm."
98,593,size of mattress that will fix in playpen that is 24\'X36\'?,The dream on me mattress measures 24\' x37\'.  It is 1\' off on the long side.  You probably can conform it to fit.  Gail
98,594,How heavy a baby will this support?,My grandson is 24 lbs n it supports him just fine. I would base it on any weight restrictions on the pack n play you use. The mattress is about 3\' thick.
98,595,does it fit the pack n pl,Fits a full size pack and play
98,596,This is for couple? I couldn't read the size of the bed. I bought this but I don't know whether it is for two or not.,I bought this item for a mini crib. Which it can also be used for a pack and play/playpen. I don't have any specifics of size. But it should only fit 1 baby. Mini cribs are very small.
99,597,Will this work with Chico key fit 30 and the baby jogger city series (I think I have a 2007 single),Make sure whatever adapter you get for your City mini specifically says for Chicco key fit 30. You have to buy a specific adapter. Look at the model number and go to the baby jogger website and look at the manual if you are unsure. I bought the wrong one the 1st time when I purchased for my Chicco car seat.
99,598,Will this work for the Baby Trend Travel System Car Seats?,"Check Baby Jogger's website. The adapter you need varies depending on the car seat you own. When I bought this one in 2011, it was specifically for the Chiccos, but they made other adapters that worked for other car seat brands."
99,599,Can I use this adaptor with the City Mini stroller?,yes. i have a city mini stroller 2012 with a chicco keyfit 30 car seat and this is the adaptor i use. just beware that this adaptor can only be used with a chicco car seat.
100,600,Are the outer edges flexible or rigid?  Is the grid flexible at all?,"The outer edges are pretty rigid (profiled plastic). The grid flexes, maybe a couple of inches in the middle."
100,601,Is this product a true 36 inch or 35.5?,"It is neither 36 or 35.5; it is smaller, width & length. More in the 34 inch range (that is the \'ears\' where the screws go in) the actual screen part is smaller."
100,602,Can this item be used to protect a full glass storm door from large breed dogs who insist on jumping up and scratching to come back in? I want to use velcro to secure it. I know I will need two for full coverage.The exposed glass area is 72 3/4\' x 28 1/2\'. This is a 36\' wide  door.,"I have three German Shepherds and they cannot get through the door saver to either the glass or a screen.  However, mine don't jump.  Really sturdy velcro might work, but I'd wonder if they would be able to pull the saver off the velcro if they get their paws above it and claw it off.  Clever, aren't they?"
100,603,Can this be attached to a metal storm door without having to drill holes in it?,"no, you do have to drill holes if you want it to stay on. I don't see any way tape would work."
100,604,Do you think this could be used on a solid wood door instead of a screen door.  My dog scratches  at the door when I leave and is ruining it.,"Maybe --- the openings in the webbing are a bit large, so depending on the size of your dogs paws he/she might still be able to reach the wood door with their nails.  The square openings are 1.25 x 1.25 inches. Once mounted on the door, there is a 3/4\' gap between the surface of the door and the guard itself.  I would imagine a very small dog might be able to reach right through the spaces to the wood if they were persistent, but probably not a larger or medium breed.  You could always set it up against the door and test it with your dog's paws before you actually mount it so you don't drill holes in the wood and then find that it won't work.  Amazon is great about returns.   Hope this helps!"
100,605,what is the size of this screen,The dimensions of this item are 34.25\'H x 30.00\'W x 1\'D.
100,606,Can this be used on a RV door?,"Hello Susan, I'm not sure.  My screen is attached to my screen door.  If your RV door has a screen door, possibly though check the measurements.  Good Luck!"
100,607,is this strong enough for squi,It's really thick Plastic I guess it would depend on how determined the squirrel is.  also he could climb it and get to your regular screen (that is unless you get the \'Pet screen\' we bought)  it's really tough.
100,608,How is this installed? Does it install behind the screen with screws or does it replace the screen?,I installs behind the screen with supplied screws.
100,609,Can this be used on a sliding patio door screen.  It's twice our Standard Poodle has gone thru the screen now.,I guess it would depend on how much clearance between the doors. It might be too deep to let the other door pass. I put this on a screen door though and I love it. My screen was only a month old when fireworks in the neighborhood caused my dog to chew thru the screen.... This really helped.
101,610,Where can I get the mobile that is in the picture of the set I bought?,"I saw such mobile on amazon, ebay and other internet web sites, just google it, good luck!"
102,611,"Hi, I want to know which brand Infant carrier can bu use on this Peg Perego Skate Stroller System ?Thx","It comes with clips so that you can attach the carseat carrier directly to the wheel base. I used a Peg Perego carseat with mine, it worked out perfectly."
102,612,Why doesn't by bassinet lock in position,It does.. Maybe you got a messed up one.. And can u be more specific about the locked in position you are talking about?  Thanks
102,613,Good nights did it want to know if the basket brings that this under the seat?,YES A LITTLE BASKET FOLD.
103,614,"The website says you can not put this bag in the washing machine but has anyone tried this, or even hand washing?","Yes! My child threw up in it, so I HAD to wash it and it did just fine. I haven't even noticed a thread out of place and I've washed it two more times since then. It still looks like new! I washed in cold on the gentle cycle and did not use fabric softener. I even tumble dried on low."
103,615,How does the main compartment close? Zipper? Magent closure?,It's a magnetic closure in the main compartment but there is a big zipper pocket inside.
103,616,"Is the bag stiff enough that it stays open, or does it flop all over when you are trying to get stuff out of it?","actually it depends on the things that you have inside the bag.the material is soft so it doesn't hold up. I usually have clothes and diapers and all sorts of stuff inside the bag, so when I take out one thing, the bag is able to stand open. if you only have a few things, then most probably it will just flop... hope this answers to your question. :)"
104,617,Is it leather?,No it was a heavy canvas material.
104,618,Is the blueprint style blanket included?,Mine did not come with anything except for the diaper bag. It is great by the way.
104,619,I was searching for this Product everywhere Online but i definitely cant find it in Europe. Would it be possible to ship it to Switzerlad? Please,"I'm sorry, but we do not ship outside the U.S."
105,620,Help with sizes on Kiddopotamus/Summer Infant Swaddleme I am trying to find the sizing for the Kiddopotamus/Summer Infant swaddlers. If you look here and change the size from say \'Small\' to \'Large\' it still gives the same weight range. So do you know where to find it? I tried looking on their website and emailing them to no avail. But perhaps I am not looking in the right place.,"My son is just under 15lbs (weighed yesterday) and this thing HUGS him. Definitely swaddles him tight with no room for movement.. I was kind of hoping it would be a little looser with growing room, but this size 'Large' is a perfect fit for him, and there are no larger sizes. If you child still likes to be swaddled tight at his/her age, then this would be perfect.. My son is 4mo's old and is kind of outgrowing being swaddled because he is still in discovery of his hands."
105,621,What is the difference between the small and small/medium?,My experience is to always take the one a little bigger so in this case the small medium since it will last longer and you can adjust it when baby is tiny.
105,622,Can this be used with arms out as well,Yes
105,623,Is the small going to fit my baby as soon as he's born?,"Yes, it fits upto 0-6 months depending on how big is your baby! Congratulations!"
106,624,"Do you know if I can just purchase the bottle brush head?  I don't need to buy the entire brush, just the head.","I think so.Here is the link just for the head.OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner, Green"
106,625,Does anyone know if this fits into Medela bottles? We're still using the 2 oz. storage bottles because my daughter doesn't eat much at once.,"Yes this does! The bristles are hard working, yet very flexible and forgiving when fitting into the bottle mouths. I have used this on medela storage bottles as well as my daughters Born Free bottles that she used later on. This bottle brush does the job well :) Only bottle brush I will ever buy. Hope this helps!"
106,626,"If water drips into the stand, does it stagnate in the stand or are there any holes for water to run out?","The middle of the stand has a hole where the water goes down into the bottom of the base, which can be removed and cleaned regularly."
106,627,Is this BPA free?,The package does state it's BPA free.
106,628,"how long is the whole brush,  wanting to use for sports bottles",it's about 11 1/2 inches long bristles to end of handle. I think it will work with most sport bottles. I hope this helps.
106,629,"Do you know is it fits Dr.Brown's standard neck bottle? It seems quite large, no?",Yes it will fit through the standard neck bottles.
107,630,would these bottles fit with low flow medela ni,"in my experience using the slow flow and calma nipples - all medela products are interchangeable. all medela tops (lids, nipples) fit all medela bottles."
107,631,How tall are these bottles?  Are they comfortable to use these with a breast pump?,"They are almost twice the height of the regular bottles that come with the pump. It takes some time to get comfortable with them because of their height, but worth it. I got these when we started weening and would go many hours between pumping. It made it so much easier because I didn't have to keep stopping to switch out full bottles."
107,632,"this is a pack of two or just one bottle at this price? ... it is not clear from the title ,,, 2 each ?!",2 bottles
107,633,Will these bottles fit the Ameda pump?,"Yes, I've used the bottles with the Ameda purely yours ultra pump, Medela single pump and Hygeia EnJoye (with adapter)"
107,634,"does it come with a box? or, they are loosely packed in plastic bag only?","plastic bag only, and then the shipping container (box in my case)."
107,635,Are these glass bottles?,"No, the bottles are plastic"
107,636,What kind of plastic are these? Are they polypropylene like other medela bottles?,"Yes - they are the same (as far as I can tell). The only difference is that the ones coming with the pump have the measures printed on the bottle (in color), while for these, they are embedded. They were perfect for me for stocking up instead of going through bags."
108,637,Are these bottles made by Medela?,"Yes they are, mine came from \'Medela\' company, they seem to be an older version. Maybe they are just getting rid of them? The are just like my other bottles except there isn't any writing on them(The pic has writing). So happy, but now I think I want more!"
108,638,"can these bottles be connected directly to the breast pump, so i can pump into the b",Yes. The adapter fits these bottles as well. I used these more frequently than the 2.5 oz slender bottles that came with the Medela pump kit / accessories.
108,639,Can we freeze the bottles?,"Yes, but you have to leave some room at the top for expansion."
108,640,"I see in the picture both the bottles and the lids are clear, do the lids not come yellow like the regular medela lids that are","Yes, the lids are the regular yellow.  The bottles don't have any tinted markings on them, just clear markings."
108,641,"Do these bottles come with the corresponding lids, or is it just the bottles themselves?",They do come with lids. Just not in regular packaging.
108,642,Are these bottles compatible with collecting milk with medela pumps?,"Yes. They also work with Medela bottles, so you can go straight from pumping and storing to feeding your baby."
108,643,Are these the wider bottles or skinny ones?,Wider bottles
109,644,Is it big enough for a 2.5 year old?,My daughter is a tiny 2.5 yo at 34\' and under thirty pounds and it works fine for her when she wants to use it any more. She started with this when she was around 20 months old. She is now 32 months old and uses the big potty primarily now.
109,645,Is the splash guard removable?,Yes
109,646,Does it work as a step stool while the toilet seat is off? I want to know if we can use it as a step stool while using the seat on the big toilet.,"yes, it can serve as a step stool for the adult toilet training as well as a stool to wash hands and brush teeth at the bath sink."
109,647,it fit to any toilet seat ?,I know it fits ours.  Which is more Oval then Round.
109,648,Does the removable seat have rubber or something underneath so it stays in place?,It has these pieces of plastic and it stays well in place.
109,649,What is the packaging dimension?,dont know
109,650,"How does the music go off? Is it a sensor in the seat, or 2 probes in the bowl?","Two probes in the bottom, once fluid is in bowl and is in contact with both the music will turn on."
110,651,what size sheet would fit this mattress and does it have to be oval?,I use Gerber 2 Pack Cotton Knit Fitted Bassinet Sheet.  They have elastic and fit the mattress fine.  Sheets do not have to be oval.
110,652,Is the surface soft (plush) or is it plastic-y?,It is covered in plastic.
110,653,"Im wondering what shape this mattress is? I need something a bit smaller then 13x29 so this would work out great, as long as its oval.",Yes it oval and fit great! Standard gerber bassinet sheets fit on it as well! If that helps!
111,654,"Is this the model which has been recalled? If so, why is it still being sold?",It is now manufactured after what the recall was for. The problem was fixed. The one I purchased over 6 months ago was not involved in the recall either.
111,655,Is there still a call back on this toy?,"Sure, there's a recall.  They never go away.  See this link http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2013/Kids-II-Recalls-Baby-Einstein-Activity-Jumpers/"
111,656,what age can use this and has this model been recalled?,Manufacturer states from about 5 months with no upper age range.  Weight limit of 25 lbs for child will probably be limiting factor for upper age. My son started using at about 5-6 months with no problem.  Their is a recall on a specific piece in the set that has been redesigned and for those who already had purchased it was replaced.  All new jumpers being sold now have the new redesigned piece.  My son has been using this for about two months and really enjoys it and I have not observed anything dangerous about the set overall or with the individual pieces.
111,657,I have a 4.5 month old daughter. Baby Einstein musical motion jumper or fisher price rainforest jumperoo ? Why ?,"I'm not familiar with the Fisher Price Jumperoo, but I started my 8 mo. old granddaughter on Baby Einstein Musical Motion Jumper and she absolutely loves it.  It entertains her for a long period and when she gets tired, she wants in her walker so she can move around the house, then she goes in her play yard.  She's very active!  Hope this helps."
111,658,What age did your baby start using this?,My little angel start at 4 months...
111,659,The description says \'Quickly fold the entire unit for easy storage and portability\' so does it fold or does it not?,We had to disassemble a little for it to \'fold\'  flat - also opted to removed a few stand up toys to prevent breaking - goes back together easily - so was not a problem.
111,660,may i know the packaging dimension when i received the,I can't give you the exact size because I threw the box away but it came in a box about the size of a 50' television...maybe smaller.
111,661,"Is it the sun toy with the purple arm that has been recalled, or the sun toy with the red/green/orange arm that has been recalled?",Red Green Orange. I didn't know it was recalled. But I also have the Bright Starts jumper. It's exactly the same model for less.
111,662,baby einstein or fisher price rainforest jumperoo ?,can't answer as I only have the baby einstein and my grand-daughter loves it!
112,663,Travel bag for Britax B Ready Does anyone know of a travel bag that will fit the b ready?,I also was looking for a bag to fit the b-ready.  Did you ever find one?
112,664,"I just got this stroller and am testing it. I'm struggling with the recline function. I got it to recline, but can't get it up anymore?","Although there is a slight recline while it is up all the way, that doesn't sound right. I agree with contacting Britax."
112,665,"Infant in toddler seat? I'm considering getting the b ready  with second seat, as I have a 15 month old and a baby due in march.  Just curious-- has anyone used the \'toddler seat\' in a fully reclined position for an infant under 6 months? Or is it a necessity to get either the Chaperone carseat or bassinet attachment? Thanks in advance for your input!","Personally, I wouldn't put a newborn in the fully reclined toddler seat. It doesn't seem very safe and comfortable when they are so little. I have used the bassinet for my baby from 0 - 7 months and now (she is 8 months) I am using the toddler seat. I think Britax also says that the toddler seat is not for children under 6 months."
112,666,The front wheels appear to be stuck on swivel. It will be a pain for me to return so I'm thinking about just keeping it. Why do I need it locked?,"You really only need them locked if you are on rough terrain. Like sand, or heavy mud (although not sure you would ever be in mud!) I have had mine for 2 years and have never locked the front wheels. Actually more annoying pushing a stroller with the front wheels locked- so hard to turn!"
112,667,What is the width of the stroller when folded at its widest point (from one end of the rear wheel to the other),"It's hard to say! when folded, the chair and the frame could be departed from each other.And the four wheel could be closed together as the frame is folded.Actually ,I am afraid the distance from the middle of the frame to the wheels is what you want to know. I think it is around 70cm"
112,668,This stroller made in USA?,I can\u00b4t remember... I think it\u00b4s made in USA
112,669,Is it possible to fold this stroller when the seat is rear-facing?,The stroller can fold with the seat facing either way but it folds more compactly if it is forward facing.
112,670,also does this come with the deattached car seats?,No unfortunately you have to purchase the car seat separately...basically what u see is what u get.
113,671,What are the approximate measurements when it's folded up and deflated? I'd like to use this for travel and want to know how much room it will take.,We have traveled with it a few times now. It's about the size of a travel pillow when deflated and folded back into the carrying bag.
113,672,Can this be used for an adult (a senior who might roll out of bed)?,"I would not. They deflate pretty easily. For example, any night my 3-year-old son ended up resting his head over it, it was completely flat by the morning.It worked great to train him to not fall off the bed. But I wouldn't use it on my 6-month-old baby or anyone larger than maybe 40lbs. Maybe a foam roll or memory foam body pillow that you can tuck under the sheets? That's what we use when visiting at my parents' house. I hope this helps."
113,673,How does this stay in place if you don't put it under a sheet? It seems like it would move/fall off easily since it's just inflatable.,"There are two strips of velvet type material on the bottom to keep it from moving easily when under a sheet.  If you were not going to put a sheet over it, then yes it would move easily and would not work as designed."
113,674,Can it be pumped up with a bicycle pump or anything else one might have already? Don't want to have to pack a pump.,It comes with a pump.  The included pump is small and can be packed.  I was also able to blow it up myself - just be blowing into the opening...
113,675,Can it be used at the head of a bed to keep the pillow from slipping between the  headboard and mattress?,I would just push the mattress up to fit tighter at the top of the bed.  It would be much safer and that's what I did for all my kids beds.
114,676,how many would you recommend to cover a 9 x 10 floor?,"Savy, you would need 90 pieces to cover a 9' x 10' area. Each set is 36 pieces, so you would need at least 3 sets."
114,677,Does the mat have a good non-slip grip on a hard floor? My baby tends to push things around the floor.,"Yes, I think so.   I have hardwood floors and they have stayed in place without fail.   I anchored one tile under the sofa when I started to put them down but this was probably not necessary.  BTW, I've had them 3 months now and they are holding up very well to 13-month-old twins."
114,678,Does this mat leave a slippery residue on a hardwood floor?,No not at all. I have installed these mats on a wood floor and its very easy to clean both the mats & the floor
114,679,"The mats have a smooth side and a textured side, which side should be facing up?","The textured side should face up, smooth side down."
114,680,Does this mat come with the edge pieces or do they have to be ordered separately?,"Hi, the edge pieces are sold separately. You can find them in the following link:eWonderWorld Beveled Side &/or Corner Edges for Interlocking Wonder MatsPlease note that we now sell the color blue to match the more colorful set.eWonderWorld"
114,681,Are they good to use in a bedroom as the flooring instead of carpet?,"Kathy, great question. You can. However, I would recommend some type of flooring underneath the mats like hardwood, tile, linoleum or carpet. These mats are not intended to be used as sub flooring."
114,682,are these mats good for going over hard wood f,Yes. Our play mats are good for hardwood floor.
115,683,"Do these work with a Medela pump, specifically the PISA or Advanced Personal Double pump? Do the adapters fit the same way as theMedela Pump and Save?","I have the Ameda double pump, I wouldn't know about other models but, it works great on mine!!I can't imagine Ameda not making them universal."
115,684,Did the box come with instructions on how to use the adapters? Mine did not.,"Mine did.  It had a little pamphlet with other product pics, too.  It's pretty easy to figure out, though.  Screw the adapter into the pump where you would normally screw the bottle, open the bag, and hang it from the two hooks on the adapter."
115,685,"does this come with two flange adapters (i.e. for double pumping), or only one?",My 20ct getting started kit from Amazon came with 2 adapters.
116,686,Does it fit in quinny buzz,I don't know. Maybe you can find a list of those strollers that buggypod smorph2 can be used with.
116,687,how easily does this detach?,"To be honest, really easily.  Too easily.  Either the way we attached this to our stroller was incorrect or it wasn't meant for our stroller.  The seat started to detach itself when we went over some sharp bumps on the street.  We tried to use it with our McClaren stroller and it didn't work.  We eventually returned it."
117,688,Will this work for a 3-way convertible crib that has only a DRAWER underneath (not another mattress)?,"Valerie, I use this on a 4-way convertible crib. It is only meant for toddler size mattresses. It isn't meant to use on twin mattress set ups anyway. It comes with two ways to install. 1. No drilling required, snaps onto the spring platform that holds the mattress, or 2. drilling required to install a bracket onto the wooden platform your mattress sits on. I did option 2 as we don't have a spring platform.Does this help? Hope so!"
117,689,"Can someone tell me how exactly it is assembled. We don't have a spring base, it is wooden.  Will it work?","I don't know that it would be worth it. It has two bars that run back to the far side. The attachments are kind of like c-clamps with bolts/butterfly knobs to hold them in place, designed to go around metal spring bases, so you'd have to do some serious bending and stretching to get it to fit on wood planks. If your base is solid wood with no gaps, then definitely no dice."
117,690,Is it strong enough to support a rough toddler?,"I have a very active and rough 2 year old and the rail stands up to being abused without any problems. Just be mindful that the rail may fight back, it gave my 2 year old a fat lip when she accidently slipped and fell on it."
117,691,How thick is the rail?  my crib mattress is only 3\' thick as it's a speciality gel kind.  will she be able to feel the bar easily?,Yes she will. There are two bars that go under the mattress and attach to the crib base. Those bars will be felt through a 3\' mattress.
117,692,Will it  work with bunkbed?,If the bunk bed has a bar like normal bed where you can adjust the straps i wouldn't see why not
117,693,Will this work on a toddler crib mattress that is on the floor?,Annie -- it should work but wont have any thing to connect too-- just the weight of the bed will hold it in place.  When it's on the metal frame in bolts on.
117,694,Has anybody used it with a Sorelle Princeton Crib? Does it work well?,Yes I have that crib. Works great with it.
117,695,does the matress comes w,No.
118,696,Does this have a mesh top (is it fully enclosed when zipped)? I looking for something that keeps the mosquito,No.  There is a mosquito cover available but you have to purchase it separately.  You can also get a UV Sun Shade which is what we bought with it and it fully covers the tops and would keep the mosquito's away.  We've ended up setting this Gocrib up in our house as a play area for our daughter.  She loves it!
118,697,Will this product work for a two year old?,"We've used portable crib, on a trip since he turned 2 years old, only for sleeping at night, because he can climb out of it now."
118,698,What are the dimensions of the whole crib once fully inflated?,"Hi, I don't know them, I just know the inflatable pad is a pack-n-play standard size. You should check the manufacturer weboage guavafamily.com"
119,699,Does it come with the infant insert?,No.  I'm not sure that there is an available insert for this carrier. I'm sorry to not be of more help!
119,700,I have a two week old newborn. The leg part on this carrier just doesn't seem comfortable for him. Does anyone use this with their newborns?,I personally didn't use mei tai carriers til my baby was older. There's ways to use it with a newborn. Check out thebabywearer.com
119,701,Does this come with a hood?,"Yes, it has a hood that snaps on."
119,702,Is there a difference between this carrier and the Infantino Mei Tai Sash? The only thing I can see is the reversible design panel.,"By comparing these two carriers one of the difference that catches my eye is that with the Sash you can wear you baby on the hip.  The Infantino Ecosash has \'3 carrying positions let baby face-in, face-out or ride like a backpack. \'thttp://www.infantino.com/product.cfm?product_id=1590 while the Sash has \'3 Carrying Positions Grow with Baby: Facing-in cozy time, Hip hugging and Backpack exploring.\' http://www.infantino.com/product.cfm?product_id=1198 ."
120,703,Is there a weight limit on the joey toddler seat? All I can find is \'for children of all ages\'.,"The seat says max weight in Joey seat is 44lbs. Hope that helps! We have loved it for our three kids ages, 3,2 and 10 months."
120,704,Is the Joey seat compatible with the City Mini double stroller?,"Hi, I think no, because valco baby double stroller has things to hold the Joey seat, you can check by Internet and you can ask from seller,"
120,705,Anyone tried jogging with this stroller?  How did it handle?  Thanks!!,"Get this stroller even if you don't jog, is a life saver no joke. Handles really really smoothly and I am a small lady. Like ANY jogger stroller straight is easiest but turns are handled well. All train for sure, works great on bumps, always have a tire pump just in case though."
120,706,Can a car seat for newborn fit in the stroller while the joey seat attachment is on?,You can't use the car seat bar with the joey seat. I put my newborn twins in the seats with blankets and they sit in it great.
120,707,Is this the new model of the seat with the higher back?,Yes it has a high back
120,708,Does the stroller fold with the Joey seat attached?,No.  the Joey seat must be removed to fold the stroller
120,709,Can you use this toddler seat on the valco twin run about model year 2006?,"Yes right now I'm using for my 2 years old son, it's very good, but when we are out side maybe he slept,  seats back cannot go down, he has to seat and sleep, but it's helping, for three kids :)"
121,710,We already own this set and are considering purchasing another. Will having 2 baby monitors in the same house cause interference?,"As Long as they are not directly across from one another, you will be a ok"
121,711,We have a sound machine in baby's room.  Does this monitor block out ambient noise and detect variable noise (baby cries) in the room,My son also has a music and projector in his room anf when he cries I hear him like he was right next to the monitor and they are both plugged into the same outlet and next to each other
121,712,I keep asking the same thing - does each unit pictured come with its own 110 volt power supply?. if so PUT EVERYTHING INCLUDED IN THE  PICTURE.,Yes it does.  The remotes can be used without the power cord.  Just charge it every once in awhile.  It will start beeping to let you know it needs a charge.
122,713,"So, why do the different colors cost different? It's just a different color, right? That makes no sense to me.",I noticed that too. makes no sense here either.
122,714,our vehicle does not have a Latch system to attach a car seat to.  Will this work with a regular seat belt?,"Yes! In fact, we didn't use the latch system(car didn't have one)  just the seat belt and the car seat did excellent in our rollover accident! Our son is now big enough to use this seat just as a booster and the seat belt works well that way as well. This seat has been a great investment for our family."
122,715,"Anyone used the Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat on an airplane? My husband and I have this car seat, and we will be taking a trip soon. We were wondering if anyone has any expeirence with this car seat on an airplane? We don't want to buy another seat just for the plane, and we have the gogo Kidz Travelmate for it. We are hoping it doesn't take up too much room and fits in the seats ok.",Did you use it with the base on the airplane? We had to remove the base to properly install it in our CRV. So was wondering if we need to carry the car seat base so it fits better in the airplane.
122,716,Will this car seat fit in my 2014 honda civic? i want to put it in the middle because it's safest but i'm not sure if it will fit. please help!,Yes! I have two in my mid size car. No one can fit between the two. I can imagine it would snug for any back seat passenger but I love ours!
123,717,How do you charge this? My daughter is looking for a night light that can't be unplugged for our 2 year old granddaughter.,"It works like a cordless phone. There is a base which you place the nightlight on all day, and you simply remove it when you'd like to use it. It is cord free, battery free (in the traditional AA, AAA sense). My daughter has it on a shelf right next to the bed. It really does illuminate the room in a glow. She has also slept with it in the bed, it is completely cool to the touch.  You can choose to set it to a short timer or have it light all night long, as well as choose one color or have it color change through its rainbow of choices. They really are adorable."
123,718,"Can you leave this charging and on all night, or do you have to remove it from the charging station to turn it on as a night light?","You cannot charge and use it simultaneously. If it's on when it's charging, the battery will become damaged."
123,719,My son wants something he can read with at night without waking his sibling on the lower bunk with the big light. Is this bright enough to read by?,"My seven year old says it's not bright enough to read a chapter book by. She says she could see well enough to read a board book or other book with big letters but not a regular book. She has very good vision, so she's probably a reliable source. Blue is brighter than the other colors so it might work, but a headlamp would be probably be a better bet for reading in a dark room."
123,720,"Is there an easy way to turn it on, in the middle of the night, for diapering and feeding?",It's easy to turn on - just push the button but it's probably not bright enough for diapering...should be ok for feeding.
123,721,How long is the battery time if leaving it on?,"Hello Chloe. The KinderGlo will typically last between 8 and 12 hours depending upon several factors.  Color mode and battery condition (how well charged the lamp is and the age of the lamp) both affect the use time. Color cycling mode uses slightly more power than a constant color mode, so the light will last for slightly less time on this setting.We hope this is helpful!"
123,722,Is there a way to reset the night light? The Dino stopped working last night. No red light when charging doesn't turn on.,"If you see no light at all it could be a problem with the base, not the Dino part. We had a problem with the base prong once. I emailed the Kinderglo company and they trouble- shooted with me to try to determine if it was something easily fixable. When it wasn't they asked me for my information and sent me a new base. In my case the metal prong was bend a bit and it simply wouldn't line up correctly to form a connection."
123,723,I'm looking for a red night light. Do you have to cycle through the different color settings every time you turn it on?,No
123,724,Does the red charging light turn green when charging is complete? We've had ours charging for 12hrs and it's still red.,All of ours have turned green once they are full charged.
123,725,My question is in regards to batteries - are they included? What battery type does it take?,"They come with a plug in, no battery."
124,726,Do you need to have the infant insert to use this with a 6 month old?,I would recommend it since a 6 month old child is not sitting very secure yet.
124,727,What is the maximum seat height?  We need a chair high enough to scoot up to the kitchen island.,We have seat on highest position for 2 yr old and it is perfect for a regular height table. Dont think it would work for counter height
124,728,Is it appropriate for a growing 6 yr old?  Will the tray adjust to for use with a growing 6 yr old?,"Yes, if you have a slim 6 year old who still needs a tray.  The tray does not adjust, but the seat will lower and your child would still fit behind the tray. Tray is removable.  I would contact the company at their website and ask for a custom tray if you need one for your child."
124,729,Could a toddler climb up and sit themselves in this chair?,Yes
124,730,Can you remove the padding on the chair to wash it?,"Yes you can.  The padding velcro's to the chair and is easily removed.  I haven't tried putting it in the washing machine, but I have hand washed it in the sink and then dried it in the dryer on low.
