I am looking for something that would prevent him to get in my cabinets.,2,"It probably will...  it's pretty good and much better than those locks for drawers you can buy at baby stores.  But it's still plastic so depending on how strong he is, he might break it.  You'll also need to keep the magnetic key away from him as he'll see you using it and likely learn.  My 3 year old tries but he doesn't know the exact spot to put the key to unlock the door.  Overall after trying several locks for cabinet doors this was the best in my opinion.  But also the hardest to install so as long as you plan and execute well according to instructions it will be fine.","Will this keep a strong 6 year old out of my cabinets?

5,38,how is this different than Dr. Brown bottles,137,It's simar to the doctor brown. I used both and I prefer the vent air. She had less formula run out her mouth with the vent air. I used these 10 years ago with my older daughter. And my lactation consultant gave them to me with this baby due to colic. So I would try them and see what works best for your baby. In my opinion these work better and take half the time to clean.,how is this different than Dr. Brown bottles It's simar to the doctor brown. I used both and I prefer the vent air.

7,43,Can I use baby bottle warmers for Playtex drop in liners system? I was wondering if anyone uses bottle armers for the pllaytex drop in systems?thanks,149,"My 18 month old son isn't using them for milk anymore, just water at bedtime, but when he was, we would warm them.  We have an earlier version of this: The First Years Night Cravings Bottle Warmer & Cooler, Blue/WhiteI don't know how others work, but with ours, you add a specific amount of water based on the amount of liquid to heat.  This in effect, decreased the warming time substantially with the drop in liners, and we also used them with pumping bags that held milk that we then poured into the liners.  We used approximately 1/4 the amount of water it said to use for the size for frozen breastmilk to warm it, and about 1/8 for milk from the fridge.  You might try testing it out a bit with some milk to see how it works.  Eventually, we went to running the bottle of whole milk under hot water from the tap while swirling it around or putting it in a bowl of hot water (but the warmer was easier at first), and finally our son accepted it at the fridge temp.  When we wanted to transition off the bottle of milk at bedtime, we started adding water to it, and then eventually went to just water.  Now the only time he gets a bottle is at bedtime, and only with water.  The rest of the time, he drinks water from the sippy cup, and juice or milk from a little plastic cup at the table.","Can I use baby bottle warmers for Playtex drop in liners system?

So I decided to finally call Fisher price. The lady was very nice and helpful.

The Snugabunny bouncy seat is just as amazing as the swing.   ;-)","Has anyone had problems with the motor failing?

Last week she managed to pull at the canopy and got it tangled in the mobile, so I've had to remove it. I'd say this swing is most useful for babies under 16 lbs and under 25\' in length. I'm now shopping for something else."

I had the graco comfortsport, it didnt fit well either rear or forward facing, went with the graco myride 65, same issue and its HUGE! tried a cheap cosco from walmart and it fit fairly well forward and not too bad rear facing but it was so flimsy I didnt feel it was going to hold up in case of a crash. Alot of my friends have the britax marathon or advocate so I decided it was time to try one but our finances dont allow a new seat. I found a used (spare seat that was never actually used) for super cheap from a local mom so I bought that and it fits PERFECTLY in our fit. It was a bit hard to get to fit that way so I had to roll up a towel but he will be forward facing pretty soon so not that major of a problem too me, all our seats have to have rolls. I would recommend this seat in a heartbeat, Im not a fan of the colors of any of the britaxs but you can always find a cover on ebay to custom fit! I also love the velcro to hold the straps so Im not digging around under his butt for the straps. I have a 14 month old who is 25 pounds and 33\' tall.","Britax seats in Prius?

21,135,"roundabout for Newborns? Hi there,i have been researching various options for our baby who is on his way in April. I am wondering about buying a convertible for our newborn. what are other experiences of folks who might have done that? Any other reccomendations?Thanks",515,"I have been thru several car seats with my son (now a toddler), good and bad, and compared experiences with many other moms. I have also asked several safety experts and car seat techs your same question.Most parents install car seats incorrectly - you'd be surprised at how tight the install must be to be correct (it took two burly firemen to install our car seat).First step, checkout Safekids dot org - select your country, then look at their website for must-read info on \'child passenger safety\' and under events for car seat inspection clinics near you. Then buy the car seat, try to install (w/o removing tags) and have them check the install BEFORE you have your baby. Then go once again with your baby - they'll check to make sure harness height is correct and that baby's harnessed correctly (plastic shield across the chest, snug around shoulders). * The best car seat for your child is that which fits your child, your car AND your budget. If possible try to buy from a baby superstore as returns are much easier, as long as you don't remove the tags.  * The safest seat for a newborn is an infant seat because it is designed for their size. The most recommended one is the Graco Snugride with EPS (this is additional protection like Styrofoam). Make sure to check as not Snugrides all have this, some are just the padding on top of plastic. The Snugride seat is very safe and after almost a year of constant use with ours it was good as new.Why not get the convertible seat? Because your baby may be too small for it and, more importantly, babies nap a lot of the time. You need something to carry them in from place to place and transferring from a fixed car seat to a stroller would wake them up. Save yourself the trouble, just get the Graco Snugride with the simple Graco stroller frame and you're set.  Skip the big Graco stroller that is often offered as a set with the infant seat - it's too heavy and bulky.* Skip Bundleme doo-das that \'keep baby warm\'. They are not safety approved and in case of a crash would compress and your baby would be loose in the harness. Same for jackets, bunting, etc., anything that would be between your baby and the car seat. Just put your baby in the car seat in their regular clothes and place a little baby blanket on top to keep them warm. You can also buy car seat bunting that go on top only, to protect baby if it's snowy.* Skip the Graco SafeSeat. It's touted as going up to 30 lbs but no mom I know can lug around baby plus this car seat after the baby hits 20 lbs (you can't always use it with the stroller base). At that point, you'll move up to the convertible car seat and buy an umbrella stroller. (On a side note I got rid of our barely used one after Consumer Reports tests showed the SafeSeat brand came off the base at high speeds - this article was retracted because the tests exceeded minimum federal requirements for car seats. Please note this did not happen with the Snugride)* Many parents find the Roundabout convertible car seat to the best car seat for the 20-40 lb range because it's very easy to install and easy to travel with. For boys, it's especially good as it has a deeper seat (7\') than others in the Britax line.  There's a Britax Diplomat with side impact protection and a new Roundabout with 50 lb max weight.* I tried the Graco Sport too but found it too large and bulky, and it was difficult to install tightly. * You can also consider getting the Britax Marathon or Boulevard, with a 20-65 lb range. A little bit harder to travel with and they're best for larger cars, although it fits in my Subaru Forester which has a small back seat. I have the Boulevard and am very happy with it.* Once you have a convertible car seat, it's best to leave it installed in your car. Buy a second car seat if possible if you have another car. Reinstalling a car seat is not easy with a child and it takes a good 15-30 minutes to get it rock solid. * Skip all the big strollers - they weigh about 30 lbs and are very hard to get into your car. Unless you have a big SUV you'll have trouble getting more things into your car (groceries, pack N play, etc). Go with the smallest all-purpose reclineable stroller with a 5 point harness you can find. For me, it was the Inglesina Trip but many parents like the McClaren Quest, with has a higher weight limit. The Volo is loved all around (smallest and lightest) but it doesn't recline. Other parents like the Combi line - I found it hard to close.* Forward facing only seats - are best for children over 30 lbs or so. Regardless of what you may have hear, the neck muscles and backbone of a 20 lb baby are not fully developed and you should keep them rear facing as long as possible (to the maximum weigh/ height recommendation on the car seat or until your child's head is 1 inch from the top). I have our convertible car seat that goes to 65 lbs, and from there I will get a booster, preferably with a 5 point harness.Lastly, consider a carrier. I tried several types and by far the most comfortable for me and baby was the Ergo carrier. There is a separate insert for newborns. This is what I used when my baby wasn't in the infant seat/ stroller frame. There are several lists on my profile with lots more information - books, baby gear and childproofing, all with the help of other moms and pros from numerous safety and child development classes I've attended.","roundabout for Newborns?

Smaller AA planes may have almost no clearance but you can still install it. The person in front won't be able to recline, so to keep everyone happy, buy the seat in front of baby for your spouse. We used it on a 5 hour flight and took turns on the non-reclining seat.We had no problems in flight and were actually approached by a flight attendant, surprised to see that it did fit rear facing (it fits my Subaru Forester which has a tiny back seat).You install easily with the lap belt according to the manual. The rear-facing tether attachment can't be used or the D-ring adaptor, but you'll need it at your destination. Clip the D-ring to the tether and remember to take it off the rental car when dropping it off.Also, the latch connectors must be tucked inside the seat as shown in the instructions (there's a slot they fit into under the foam). Get to the gate early and ask to board along with first class as you'll need 5-10 minutes to do this. When installing rearfacing, get a tight fit by reclining the airplane seat first, then pass the seatbelt through the slots as shown. Put your knee on the seat to weigh it down, tighten the seatbelt, and then put the plane seat back in its upright position. If the lap belt is too short, ask for a belt extender. The plane's belt buckle will be under baby's bottom, but the foam on the Britax cushions it significantly. Car seats without thick padding will likely be uncomfortable for baby, especially on long trips. The Britax belly pad is easy to lose at this point as you need to take it off the crotch strap to install the seat, so remember to put it away and/ or put it back on. IMPORTANT: Plane belts buckle in the center, not on the side like a car's; if installing FORWARD facing, ask for a seat belt extender and FLIPthe buckle over a half turn (away from car seat), as if the seatbelt buckle/ clasp is tight against the car seat you won't be able to lift it to release it!

The plane's belt buckle will be under baby's bottom, but the foam on the Britax cushions it significantly. Car seats without thick padding will likely be uncomfortable for baby, especially on long trips. The Britax belly pad is easy to lose at this point as you need to take it off the crotch strap to install the seat, so remember to put it away and/ or put it back on. IMPORTANT: Plane belts buckle in the center, not on the side like a car's; if installing FORWARD facing, ask for a seat belt extender and FLIPthe buckle over a half turn (away from car seat), as if the seatbelt buckle/ clasp is tight against the car seat you won't be able to lift it to release it! See page 20 in the manual for instructions. http://www.britaxusa.net/pdf/guide_roundabout.pdf See page 22 for full instructions for plane installs."

When we've flown, we've had to have the seat rear-facing and had trouble with both the aircraft crew and the person in front of us.  Many of the aircraft crew were not used to seeing a rear-facing seat since most people don't buy their infants a ticket when they're under 2 (it was a long flight, so we bought our son his own seat).  Then, the person in front of us couldn't recline his seat because the car seat got in the way and the got upset.

31,199,Does the seat adjust?,772,"There are two different places to put the seat belt thru to accomodate a growing child.  Also the seat has 2 different positions to recline.  The seat can face forward for a side to side motion, or can easily be turned to move into a front to back motion.  To be honest.. this is the best swing you can get as far as features.  I love that it plugs into the wall, that the seat can be turned either direction depending on what the infant likes, and that the mobile lifts up to allow easy access to get baby in and out of the seat. I loved it!  You can't go wrong with this swing!","Does the seat adjust? There are two different places to put the seat belt thru to accomodate a growing child.

It should fit the GT since it attaches by the top of the stroller & not the push handle (which are different shapes on the two models). I would compare lengths on babyjogger.com, measuring from highest to the lowest part of the stroller \'carriage body\'. There is a bit extra give by the lowest point which is where you'd need a little more coverage, due to a more square shape, if I recall correctly. When I was comparing this canopy with the one from buy buy baby that is made for it, many reviews stated that the black cover blocked the \'window\' to see your child. 100% agree. So happy I bought the all clear one.","Will this fit City Mini GT stroller? I love this canopy. Super easy to use, great for rain & blocking winter wind.

Thanks.",955,"You can put 2 of these together as Carolyn and some other reviewers have said, however Carolyn's math is quite a bit off.  I went and figured it out myself.  A hexagon with 2ft sides is a little over 10 square feet, as it says.  Adding the 2 panel extension makes it an octagon, which would be slightly more than 19 square ft, also as stated.  The difference is that combining 2 yards would have 12 panels and be a dodecagon, which would be about 44.8 square feet.  You'd have to get 3 sets of extensions to equal the same area, since all the sides are 2ft in length.  The extensions currently cost 52.14, which is 156.42.  The playyard itself is 155.96.  Thus you are getting a better deal with 2 playyards.  Not only is it slightly cheaper, it also gives you an extra door panel.  That means it's more adaptable for using as 2 separate gates if you want to at some point.","Hi, can I join 2 of these North States Superyard 3 in 1 Wood Gates to make an extra large play area?

41,258,How is the stage 2 nipple?  Is it a pretty fast flow or is it still conservative (to mimic the breast)?,998,"Conservative!  They still have to work at it to get the milk to come out.

If the child can't work the stage 1 nipple then they may still have problems with the stage 2.","How is the stage 2 nipple?

I would imagine a toddler would enjoy the music as well, even if the rattle aspect of the toy is no longer entertaining to them."

Prior to the baby's ability to hold the toy safely, you can just place it close by and play the music for him or her. Exposure to good music is always a positive thing and good for baby's developing brain.","What is the age range for this gift? My grandbaby is nine months old and plays with the toy now.

It cited Prop 65.  If you click on the link it comes up with:\'Proposition 65Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in November 1986. The Proposition was intended by its authors to protect California citizens and the State's drinking water sources from chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals.Proposition 65 requires the Governor to publish, at least annually, a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\'I contacted the Office of Environmental Health Hazzard Assessment and they said that the manufacturer is responsible for keeping track of chemicals that they include in their products that are considered toxic and informing the consumer of those chemicals.  They DID inform the consumer, right on the Amazon website, but after I questioned the warning they REMOVED it!  If the toxic part is inside the toy then that isn't as big of a deal and I would buy it anyway.  If it's outside then I feel that I have the right to know.

Our products are latex free and paint materials are non-toxic. Our products meet and pass necessary requirements for phthalates, PVC's and BPA's. In addition to the tests that are performed by both U.S. and International standards, we also perform testing and go through extra safety procedures with parents and children within our local area. Not only do our products meet the requirements they are also certified by the accredited independent laboratories mentioned with Intertek and Bureau Veritas. In being a private company I hope that you will understand that we are unable to provide specific details on the materials within the products. However in being parents ourselves, we want to share the same confidence with you that we have in allowing our children to play with our products. In other words...they refused to tell me exactly what the warning was pertaining to!  I wrote back for further clarification and haven't received a response.  Today, about a week and a half later and they have now REMOVED the link to the warning!!!  What's going on?  Is this toxic or isn't it???http://www.oehha.org/prop65.htmlAny info would be appreciated!  Thanks.Nadine Thanks for your reply.  If the product is safe then why the warning?  It cited Prop 65.  If you click on the link it comes up with:\'Proposition 65Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in November 1986. The Proposition was intended by its authors to protect California citizens and the State's drinking water sources from chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals.Proposition 65 requires the Governor to publish, at least annually, a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\'I contacted the Office of Environmental Health Hazzard Assessment and they said that the manufacturer is responsible for keeping track of chemicals that they include in their products that are considered toxic and informing the consumer of those chemicals.  They DID inform the consumer, right on the Amazon website, but after I questioned the warning they REMOVED it!  If the toxic part is inside the toy then that isn't as big of a deal and I would buy it anyway.  If it's outside then I feel that I have the right to know.  I asked the manufacturer this and they still have yet to answer.  I don't understand what all the secrecy is about.  Thanks again for your reply.~Nadine"

You attatch the Hitch Hiker to one of the outside legs and the middle part. That leaves the space behind the other seat for you to walk. The standing child will need to hold on to the bar in front of them. Occasionally for really sharp turns you'll need to reach around the child and grab the outside handles to make the turn, but for most walking and steering, I've found that just holding onto the open space is enough.On our Combi double stroller we leave the attatchment brackets on the back legs to fold it up, but we do remove the Hitch Hiker board itself every time.

57,350,"Contours Tandem VS City Min? We are trying to figure out what stroller we should get for our newborn and 21 month old... I think we have it narrowed down to the countours tandem and the city mini. We are looking for something that is durable, easy to lift in & out of my SUV, something that can handle both dirt paths and sidewalks and something that can go in & out of stores easily.

We have had both strollers.  We started with the Contours Tandem.  I liked all the variations and options it seemed to have, especially that the carseats could go directly onto the stroller (we bought the extra attachment).  Unfortunately, by about 6 months I was feeling like it was so difficult to maneuver and was somewhat cumbersome.  We were going to travel by airplane and didn't feel it would be able to travel with us because of it's size/weight etc.  We ended up buying the City Mini and have LOVED it.  It is much easier to fold, put into and out of vehicles.  It fits better as it folds in half instead of upright, which is how the Contours folds, which then needs to be turned on it's side to put into the car.  The mini can be pushed, turned, maneuvered in almost any way with just one hand!  It has fit through all but one door in a very old building.  It has traveled with us many times and we couldn't live without it.  Our twins are now 19 months old and will be able to use it for quite some time (as our 5 year old occasionally wants to be strolled in it, I know there is lots of growing room). While the Contours has so many great ideas (seat positions etc.) it was just too hard to handle.  I would highly recommend the City mini to anyone with a need for a double stroller.  We LOVE it!","Contours Tandem VS City Min? We are trying to figure out what stroller we should get for our newborn and 21 month old...

I recently had a baby (hence the double stroller) and am first really emerging from the fog.My 2 and half year old is about 34-35 lbs and he loves the stroller.  I know what other people have said about it being too small but my son loves it.  He thinks it looks like a spaceship \'pod\' and likes for us to \'blast-off!\' together.My only complaint with the stoller so far is that it hard to hear my older son who sits in the front as we are strolling.  He feels \'far away\'.  It is also difficult to get in and out of elevators and certain doors.

We always turn our watch off for naps and bedtime and turn on again in the morning. Side note: we have used this watch daily for 3 months and the batteries are still good. Hope this helps!"

65,401,"Is it necessary to buy this if we have the waterproof mattress? First time parent, not sure what to expect :)",1534,"I would definitely recommend the mattress cover even though the mattress is waterproof.  In fact, I would get 2 of them; one to wash and one to use.  You don't want the mattress smelling like pee for one, and it definitely will if you don't.  It will also just be a lot cleaner.  I'm all about making less of a mess if I can to have less to clean since there is already so much other cleaning that cannot be avoided.  And pee is the cleanest thing that can end up on the mattress!  I like to use peroxide in  a spray bottle with paper towels when I do clean a waterproof mattress.  I like that it doesn't smell and does a good job cleaning.  I think it's a safer cleaner compared to say a Clorox wipe. I would recommend the flat one, instead of the fitted, so it will be easier to change.  Or if your mattress isn't too heavy, it's really no big deal just to take the entire mattress out to change it so in that case the fitted would be fine too.  (But then you have to take the crib bumper off.  I actually took mine off since I got tired of taking it off and on all of the time.)Hopefully you have a Naturepedic mattress or other brand that doesn't use fire retardant chemicals to pass the flammability test. I've even read on a natural health doctor's website that when the pee, or other bodily fluids, mix with the fire retardant chemicals, it has a chemical reaction that makes an odorless gas that can cause SIDS.","Is it necessary to buy this if we have the waterproof mattress?

If your bed has a barrier at one end, it probably won't fit since the rail is pretty long.  Plus the rail has some weight to it, so the twin mattress helps to hold it in place.

I've bought 2 & used for 3 of my kids...it's the best out there!For younger babies like yours- It still seats very well. The 5 point harness holds them in snugly & I would suggest rolling a burp cloth behind her neck for support until she can hold her neck upright well. Regardless, she will enjoy sitting & watching"

At that point he could stand on his own and move all around.  He has never tried to untie them, though I am sure he could.  To me at that point it was no more dangerous than the blanket he sleeps with every night.  The big risk for suffocation with bumpers and things is that the infant is not able to roll over or move so that they can breathe.  Truthfully you do not need this before they can pull up and stand and eat the furniture and at that point the risk of suffocation is so much lower it has never been a concern.  This is a great product and looks great on my crib, and is way better than him chewing and eating the paint on the crib.

84,502,Are there any dentist reviews on the wubbanub with toy being heavier than just a pacifier in the mouth and its impact on developing teeth?,1907,I'm a dentist and would not recommend it.  I routinely see kids with an open bite (front teeth do not come together) due to a pacifier or even thumb or finger habit.  Not all kids develop this--but many do.  Adding a weight (any weight) to the end of the pacifier will require the child to hold onto it tighter with their jaws and teeth--and if your kid is one of the \'lucky\' ones who develops an open bite it will be worse than if you had been using a pacifier alone--and you'll be more likely to be \'lucky\' enough to pay for braces when they are older.  I am not opposed to pacifiers for infants--just the ones with weights on them.  And as an FYI stopping their use (or a thumb or finger habit) by age 2 or at the latest 4 gives you the best chance of not affecting their jaw and teeth development.,Are there any dentist reviews on the wubbanub with toy being heavier than just a pacifier in the mouth and its impact on developing teeth?

What I do know is that the part that attaches is sort of like a clip. The opening is about 1 1/2 inch wide and you twist the circle orange attached on the top of the clip to tighten it. I did use it on a infant carrier my mother in law bought me, but don't recall the brand. The whole musical toy is adjustable and can be clipped onto any surface that can be clipped if its not bigger than 1 1/2 inch wide. I hung it upside down, upright, and different ways. Overall, I like it because I can hang other toys onto it. Still have it and I still don't know how to get the other song to turn on. I drop it and oh yah, the other song turns on. I hit it, nothing. Oh well. Hope this helps."

90,532,Why should this product only be used with cotton bedding?  Will it be a problem if my mattress is not cotton?,2006,"After wrapping the mattress in the Serendipity protector, additional layers of bedding should be all cotton.  Mattress material does not matter - you're wrapping it to prevent off-gassing of the fire retardants and other chemicals inside the mattress which would be breathed in by your baby. These still escape, but harmlessly through the bottom of the wrap's vents underneath the mattress.  On top of the wrap is to be only cotton fabric. We used a 30 x 54 (approx) washed 100% cotton white bath towel as a mattress 'pad' - just for a bit of absorbency. Babies must not have fluffy padding in their beds! On top of the towel was placed a cotton fitted sheet. That's all you need - mattress wrap (which is already waterproof), towels and sheets. Practical, easy to change, and healthy for baby. Use unscented detergent and no fabric softener. Simple and safe.","Why should this product only be used with cotton bedding?  Will it be a problem if my mattress is not cotton?

Their purpose is to soak up the drool from your teething baby so that you don't have to wash the carrier every time you use it--you just wash the pads. Here's what happens--you put your baby into the carrier and he or she immediately starts sucking on the shoulder straps. Within ten minutes, both straps are soaked through. This prevents that from happening. You should get them if you get the carrier--get two sets. Keep in mind that you probably won't need to pull them out until your baby is around 4 months old.

93,553,nipple size,2074,"We ordered a variety of different nipples. We are currently using the slow flow (0+ months) which are for newborns so they are the smallest size. We also bought a 2 pack of the medium flow (2+ months) nipples, a 2 pack of the fast flow (4+ months) nipples, and a 2 pack of the X cut (6+ months) nipples. We will use each set as she progresses in age. From what I understand the nipples increase in size (both circumference and length) as the flow increases. If your baby is a fast eater and makes big gulps (like ours does), then I would recommend using a smaller size nipple than recommended for their age to limit their intake and keep them from overeating. Gulping is a major cause of gas and colick. So if you can limit the amount of formula they are getting from each swallow then that will help combat the gas, colick and pain resulting from both of those.","nipple size We ordered a variety of different nipples.

That makes no sense to me.",2636,"I have actually spoke with an Amazon rep and for items sold by Amazon it's based on supply and demand.
