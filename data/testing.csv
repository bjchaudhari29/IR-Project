"HORRIBLE installation experience. Installed per instructions on 10 cabinet drawers, using the supplied templates. Because the drawers can wiggle slightly in their tracks, the locks failed and the drawers popped out with a tug. The only way it would work is if all of the holes were re-drilled so the lock is PERFECTLY aligned with the stop tab. Imperfection either meant the lock didn't work or the lock pushed the drawer to one side, causing the drawer fronts to look misaligned and ugly. After 4+ hours and 50+ drilling modifications, the supplied drill bit guide failed resulting in the drill bit going through the front of a brand new drawer front (which would have cost $140 to replace, but I used some wood filler instead and it looks \'OK\'). Less than a day after installation, one of the locks stuck in the unlocked position and had to be replace because it could not be reliably fixed. All of this was enough to make me completely hate these things."
"I wish we'd bought the cheaper \'push latch\' safety locks.  These are most effective in that they really keep the doors shut tight.  Unfortunately, looking around for the lock is more annoying.  Most of the time, you just want to open your cabinets quickly and with one hand.  Plus, they are quite expensive."
"'The concept is great, but these things are a nightmare to install.  I tried these with our first son, 3 years ago in our previous house.  I gave up after installing and the stupid things didn't work because the magnet didn't reach well enough.  Well, 3 years later and another baby - stupid me, I figured I would try again.  First, they want you to drill a giant hole in your cabinet doors.  Who has a 9/32&#34; drill bit anyway?  I was very concerned about drilling right through the door.  Then you have to have everything lined up just right, and have the right extension piece, that the magnet actually unlocks the lock.  If your cabinets are like cardboard, maybe these will work.  But if you try it on maple or oak cabinets, good luck.  The magnet isn't strong enough and the risk of damaging your cabinets while trying to get it just right is just too high.  Sorry I wasted another 2 hours of my life trying to get the first one done."
"'My husband installed 4 of these locks on my sewing table.  It took him approximately 45 minutes to install all 4 (Including time for me to empty out the overfull drawers!).  My sewing cabinet has 3 drawers and 1 cabinet.They come with a sticky template that he thought was wonderful. My drawers are over 3/4 inches thick and with the extensions the locks worked great! They came with a drill bit marker to make sure you stop before you drill through the front of the drawer.I have heard that the older packages did not include the drill marker or the templates.  I guess they have corrected the issues people have been complaining about.Pros: Drill bit marker, sticky templates, ease of use, the drawer does not open at all (keeps curious little fingers out of my pins!), little red latch to keep drawer in open position if you are going to use it a lot, and super strong!Cons: Pricey and instruction sheet had a lot of acronyms but if you read through it before installing it is okay.Now we know they work great and are fairly easy to install we are getting more."
